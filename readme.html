	<h2 id="requirements">Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>
		We will assume that you have some general developer experience.<br />
		If you do find anything which you don't understand in this document, feel free to ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the software department, you'll need the following for building HeidiSQL:
		<ul><li>Borland Developer Studio 2006</li></ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		All third party components and dependencies used by HeidiSQL is included in the Subversion
		repository and the source package.
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h2 id="compiler">What is Borland Developer Studio?</h2>
	<p>
		Delphi is a graphical development environment.  It uses a language which is as powerful as C++,
		but has a much clearer and better syntax, named Pascal.  Pascal is a modern language, with major
		benefits compared to other languages, among them is great support for Structured Exception Handling,
		the various types of strings in existence, componentized development, and other things.  It also has
		it's drawbacks, mostly minor things on the technical front like for example the newbie-friendly but
		overly verbose "begin -> end" scope declarators and lack of various syntactic sugar such as "+=" and "?:".
	</p>

	<p>
		On the corporate side of things are more grave issues, such as lack of communication with developers
		and Borland seemingly wanting to get rid of the compiler business as a whole.  Luckily, we don't have
		to care too much about that, as the product pretty much works just fine as it is :-).
	</p>

	<p>
		Borland Developer Studio (BDS) is the name of the successor of the Delphi environment.
		BDS 2005 is also known as Delphi 9, and BDS 2006 is also known as Delphi 10.  We'll be using the name
		"Delphi", both when we refer to older versions and to newer ones (BDS).
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h2 id="compilerversion">Which version of Delphi do I need?</h2>
	<p>
		HeidiSQL actually builds with at least Delphi 6 and upwards, but there's only a complete set of project
		files for Delphi 10.  There's incomplete support for Delphi 6 in the source codes, only a few
		projects are missing.  For other environments, much more may be missing.  If you want to make life
		easy for yourself, just get Delphi 10 ;-).
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h2 id="downloading">Downloading the source code</h2>
	<p>
		If you haven't already done so, retrieve a copy of the source code.<br />
		Preferably, use Subversion to check out a working copy.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use TortoiseSVN (a graphical client), or the command line Subversion client like so:
		<div>
			<code>svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/heidisql heidisql</code>
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, download a source tarball from the file area:<br />
		<a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=164593&package_id=186427'>HeidiSQL file area on SourceForge</a>
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>
	<p>
		Start by compiling and installing the components that HeidiSQL depends on.
	</p>

	<p>
		HeidiSQL has one directory named "packages" for each component and for HeidiSQL itself, this is where
		you'll find the project files.
	</p>

	<p>
		Delphi has a distinction between "design-time components" and "run-time components".  To compile
		HeidiSQL correctly, the designtime components that it depends on needs to be "Installed" into the
		Borland environment, otherwise Delphi will fail to compile HeidiSQL.  You can Install a project
		by right-clicking the project in the "Project Manager" in Delphi and choosing "Install".
	</p>

	<p>
		Open these projects in Delphi and perform the action listed:
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Relative path</th>
				<th>Action</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>components/edbimage/packages/delphi10/VCLSer100.bdsproj</td>
				<td>Build All</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>components/edbimage/packages/delphi10/DCLSer100.bdsproj</td>
				<td>Build All + Install "DCLSer100"</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>components/heidisql/packages/delphi10/HeidiComponents.bdsproj</td>
				<td>Build All + Install "HeidiComponents"</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>components/smdbgrid/packages/delphi10/SMDBGridComponents.bdsproj</td>
				<td>Build All + Install "SMDBGridComponents"</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>components/synedit/packages/delphi10/SynEdit_D10.bdsproj</td>
				<td>Build All + Install "SynEdit_D10"</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>components/zeosdbo/packages/delphi10/ZeosDbo.bdsgroup</td>
				<td>Build All + Install "ZComponent"</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</p>

	<p>
		Once you're done, you are ready to compile HeidiSQL itself:
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Relative path</th>
				<th>Action</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>packages/delphi10/heidisql.bdsproj</td>
				<td>Build All</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</p>

	<p>
		You should end up with a "heidisql.exe" binary in the "out" folder.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ta-ta!  We're done ;-).
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

	<h3>"Unable to install component" error message</h3>
	<p>
		Remove the (already installed) component by going to Project --> Options --> Packages,
		selecting the relevant component and clicking 'Remove'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then try installing the component again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've successfully installed a design-time component, Delphi should reinstall
		it the next time you compile the package containing the component.
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

	<h3>What's the difference between designtime and runtime components?</h3>
	<p>
		(Note: "a component" in this context equals "a project".)
	</p>
	<p>
		Designtime components are meant to provide functionality to the Borland environment.  For example,
		a designtime component often has a procedure named "Register", which will install the component into
		the Borland environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea of separating designtime and runtime is that designtime code does not need to be linked
		into the final executable, thus saving space.  See this article for details:<br />
		<a href='http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,27717,00.html'>http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,27717,00.html</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		If in doubt, you can always choose "designtime and runtime".  If you do designate a project as being
		"designtime only", but some code is really required at runtime, the linker seems to be clever enough
		to include the component in the final executable anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		Runtime components are meant to be included in the final executable.  Runtime components can probably
		not be "Installed" into the Borland environment.  Runtime components can be compiled into BPL files,
		which is a sort of fancy DLL.
	</p>

	<h3>How do I find out what's changed in a ".res" file?</h3>
	<p>
		I have no clue.  If you find out, please update this readme.<br />
		Supposedly, one can use textual RC files instead of binary RES files, and by adding the RC files to
		a project, Delphi should compile them into RES files on demand.  That's probably what we should do.
	</p>

	<h3>What tool is practical for editing the multi-icon bitmap in /res/icons8bit.bmp?</h3>
	<p>
		I have no clue.  If you know, please update this readme.
