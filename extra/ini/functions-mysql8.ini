[AES_ENCRYPT]
declaration=str,key_str[,init_vector][,kdf_name][,salt][,info | iterations]
category=Encryption Functions
description=AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() implement encryption and decryption of\ndata using the official AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm,\npreviously known as "Rijndael." The AES standard permits various key\nlengths. By default these functions implement AES with a 128-bit key\nlength. Key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be used, as described later.\nThe key length is a trade off between performance and security.\n\nAES_ENCRYPT() encrypts the string str using the key string key_str, and\nreturns a binary string containing the encrypted output. AES_DECRYPT()\ndecrypts the encrypted string crypt_str using the key string key_str,\nand returns the original (binary) string in hexadecimal format. (To\nobtain the string as plaintext, cast the result to CHAR. Alternatively,\nstart the mysql client with --skip-binary-as-hex to cause all binary\nvalues to be displayed as text.) If either function argument is NULL,\nthe function returns NULL. If AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid data or\nincorrect padding, it returns NULL. However, it is possible for\nAES_DECRYPT() to return a non-NULL value (possibly garbage) if the\ninput data or the key is invalid.\n\nThese functions support the use of a key derivation function (KDF) to\ncreate a cryptographically strong secret key from the information\npassed in key_str. The derived key is used to encrypt and decrypt the\ndata, and it remains in the MySQL Server instance and is not accessible\nto users. Using a KDF is highly recommended, as it provides better\nsecurity than specifying your own premade key or deriving it by a\nsimpler method as you use the function. The functions support HKDF\n(available from OpenSSL 1.1.0), for which you can specify an optional\nsalt and context-specific information to include in the keying\nmaterial, and PBKDF2 (available from OpenSSL 1.0.2), for which you can\nspecify an optional salt and set the number of iterations used to\nproduce the key.\n\nAES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() permit control of the block encryption\nmode. The block_encryption_mode system variable controls the mode for\nblock-based encryption algorithms. Its default value is aes-128-ecb,\nwhich signifies encryption using a key length of 128 bits and ECB mode.\nFor a description of the permitted values of this variable, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/server-system-variables.html.\nThe optional init_vector argument is used to provide an initialization\nvector for block encryption modes that require it.\n\nStatements that use AES_ENCRYPT() or AES_DECRYPT() are unsafe for\nstatement-based replication.\n\nIf AES_ENCRYPT() is invoked from within the mysql client, binary\nstrings display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of\nthe --binary-as-hex. For more information about that option, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/mysql.html.\n\nThe arguments for the AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() functions are as\n ...
[ANY_VALUE]
declaration=arg
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=This function is useful for GROUP BY queries when the\nONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode is enabled, for cases when MySQL rejects a\nquery that you know is valid for reasons that MySQL cannot determine.\nThe function return value and type are the same as the return value and\ntype of its argument, but the function result is not checked for the\nONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode.\n\nFor example, if name is a nonindexed column, the following query fails\nwith ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled:\n\nmysql> SELECT name, address, MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;\nERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP\nBY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.address' which\nis not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this\nis incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by\n\nThe failure occurs because address is a nonaggregated column that is\nneither named among GROUP BY columns nor functionally dependent on\nthem. As a result, the address value for rows within each name group is\nnondeterministic. There are multiple ways to cause MySQL to accept the\nquery:\n\no Alter the table to make name a primary key or a unique NOT NULL\n  column. This enables MySQL to determine that address is functionally\n  dependent on name; that is, address is uniquely determined by name.\n  (This technique is inapplicable if NULL must be permitted as a valid\n  name value.)\n\no Use ANY_VALUE() to refer to address:\n\nSELECT name, ANY_VALUE(address), MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;\n\n  In this case, MySQL ignores the nondeterminism of address values\n  within each name group and accepts the query. This may be useful if\n  you simply do not care which value of a nonaggregated column is\n  chosen for each group. ANY_VALUE() is not an aggregate function,\n  unlike functions such as SUM() or COUNT(). It simply acts to suppress\n  the test for nondeterminism.\n\no Disable ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY. This is equivalent to using ANY_VALUE()\n  with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled, as described in the previous item.\n\nANY_VALUE() is also useful if functional dependence exists between\ncolumns but MySQL cannot determine it. The following query is valid\nbecause age is functionally dependent on the grouping column age-1, but\nMySQL cannot tell that and rejects the query with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY\nenabled:\n\nSELECT age FROM t GROUP BY age-1;\n\n ...

The function\nsupports decryption for content encrypted by the legacy openssl_udf\nshared library functions if the system variable\nenterprise_encryption.rsa_support_legacy_padding is set to ON (the\ndefault is OFF). When ON is set, the function also supports the\nRSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 padding scheme, as used by the legacy openssl_udf\nshared library functions. When OFF is set, content encrypted by the\nlegacy functions cannot be decrypted, and the function returns null\noutput for such content.\n\nalgorithm is the encryption algorithm used to create the key. The\nsupported algorithm value is 'RSA'.\n\ndata_str is the encrypted string to decrypt, which was encrypted with\nasymmetric_encrypt().\n\npriv_key_str is a valid PEM encoded RSA private key. For successful\ndecryption, the key string must correspond to the public key string\nused with asymmetric_encrypt() to produce the encrypted string. The\nasymmetric_encrypt() component function only supports encryption using\na public key, so decryption takes place with the corresponding private\nkey.\n\nFor a usage example, see the description of asymmetric_encrypt().\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/enterprise-encryption-functions.html

If key derivation fails, the result is NULL.\n\npub_key_str and priv_key_str are valid PEM encoded key strings that\nwere created using the DH algorithm.\n\nSuppose that you have two pairs of public and private keys:\n\nSET @dhp = create_dh_parameters(1024);\nSET @priv1 = create_asymmetric_priv_key('DH', @dhp);\nSET @pub1 = create_asymmetric_pub_key('DH', @priv1);\nSET @priv2 = create_asymmetric_priv_key('DH', @dhp);\nSET @pub2 = create_asymmetric_pub_key('DH', @priv2);\n\nSuppose further that you use the private key from one pair and the\npublic key from the other pair to create a symmetric key string. Then\nthis symmetric key identity relationship holds:\n\nasymmetric_derive(@pub1, @priv2) = asymmetric_derive(@pub2, @priv1)\n\nThis example requires DH private/public keys as inputs, created using a\nshared symmetric secret. Create the secret by passing the key length to\ncreate_dh_parameters(), then pass the secret as the "key length" to\ncreate_asymmetric_priv_key().\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/enterprise-encryption-functions-legacy.html

[EXPORT_SET]
declaration=bits,on,off[,separator[,number_of_bits]]
category=String Functions
description=Returns a string such that for every bit set in the value bits, you get\nan on string and for every bit not set in the value, you get an off\nstring. Bits in bits are examined from right to left (from low-order to\nhigh-order bits). Strings are added to the result from left to right,\nseparated by the separator string (the default being the comma\ncharacter ,). The number of bits examined is given by number_of_bits,\nwhich has a default of 64 if not specified. number_of_bits is silently\nclipped to 64 if larger than 64. It is treated as an unsigned integer,\nso a value of −1 is effectively the same as 64.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/string-functions.html
[EXTRACT]
declaration=unit FROM date
category=Date and Time Functions
description=The EXTRACT() function uses the same kinds of unit specifiers as\nDATE_ADD() or DATE_SUB(), but extracts parts from the date rather than\nperforming date arithmetic. For information on the unit argument, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/expressions.html#temporal-inter\nvals. Returns NULL if date is NULL.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/date-and-time-functions.html
[EXTRACTVALUE]
declaration=xml_frag, xpath_expr
category=XML
description=ExtractValue() takes two string arguments, a fragment of XML markup\nxml_frag and an XPath expression xpath_expr (also known as a locator);\nit returns the text (CDATA) of the first text node which is a child of\nthe element or elements matched by the XPath expression.\n\nUsing this function is the equivalent of performing a match using the\nxpath_expr after appending /text(). In other words,\nExtractValue('<a><b>Sakila</b></a>', '/a/b') and\nExtractValue('<a><b>Sakila</b></a>', '/a/b/text()') produce the same\nresult. If xml_frag or xpath_expr is NULL, the function returns NULL.\n\nIf multiple matches are found, the content of the first child text node\nof each matching element is returned (in the order matched) as a\nsingle, space-delimited string.\n\nIf no matching text node is found for the expression (including the\nimplicit /text())---for whatever reason, as long as xpath_expr is\nvalid, and xml_frag consists of elements which are properly nested and\nclosed---an empty string is returned. No distinction is made between a\nmatch on an empty element and no match at all. This is by design.\n\nIf you need to determine whether no matching element was found in\nxml_frag or such an element was found but contained no child text\nnodes, you should test the result of an expression that uses the XPath\ncount() function. For example, both of these statements return an empty\nstring, as shown here:\n\nmysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', '/a/b');\n+-------------------------------------+\n| ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', '/a/b') |\n+-------------------------------------+\n|                                     |\n+-------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', '/a/b');\n+-------------------------------------+\n| ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', '/a/b') |\n+-------------------------------------+\n|                                     |\n+-------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nHowever, you can determine whether there was actually a matching\nelement using the following:\n\nmysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', 'count(/a/b)');\n+-------------------------------------+\n| ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', 'count(/a/b)') |\n+-------------------------------------+\n ...

When unix_timestamp is a decimal value, the\nfractional seconds precision of the DATETIME is the same as the\nprecision of the decimal value, up to a maximum of 6. When\nunix_timestamp is a floating point number, the fractional seconds\nprecision of the datetime is 6.\n\nOn 32-bit platforms, the maximum useful value for unix_timestamp is\n2147483647.999999, which returns '2038-01-19 03:14:07.999999' UTC.

[GET_LOCK]
declaration=str,timeout
category=Locking Functions
description=Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string str, using a\ntimeout of timeout seconds. A negative timeout value means infinite\ntimeout. The lock is exclusive. While held by one session, other\nsessions cannot obtain a lock of the same name.\n\nReturns 1 if the lock was obtained successfully, 0 if the attempt timed\nout (for example, because another client has previously locked the\nname), or NULL if an error occurred (such as running out of memory or\nthe thread was killed with mysqladmin kill).\n\nA lock obtained with GET_LOCK() is released explicitly by executing\nRELEASE_LOCK() or implicitly when your session terminates (either\nnormally or abnormally). Locks obtained with GET_LOCK() are not\nreleased when transactions commit or roll back.\n\nGET_LOCK() is implemented using the metadata locking (MDL) subsystem.\nMultiple simultaneous locks can be acquired and GET_LOCK() does not\nrelease any existing locks. For example, suppose that you execute these\nstatements:\n\nSELECT GET_LOCK('lock1',10);\nSELECT GET_LOCK('lock2',10);\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock2');\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock1');\n\nThe second GET_LOCK() acquires a second lock and both RELEASE_LOCK()\ncalls return 1 (success).\n\nIt is even possible for a given session to acquire multiple locks for\nthe same name. Other sessions cannot acquire a lock with that name\nuntil the acquiring session releases all its locks for the name.\n\nUniquely named locks acquired with GET_LOCK() appear in the Performance\nSchema metadata_locks table. The OBJECT_TYPE column says USER LEVEL\nLOCK and the OBJECT_NAME column indicates the lock name. In the case\nthat multiple locks are acquired for the same name, only the first lock\nfor the name registers a row in the metadata_locks table. Subsequent\nlocks for the name increment a counter in the lock but do not acquire\nadditional metadata locks. The metadata_locks row for the lock is\ndeleted when the last lock instance on the name is released.\n\nThe capability of acquiring multiple locks means there is the\npossibility of deadlock among clients. When this happens, the server\nchooses a caller and terminates its lock-acquisition request with an\nER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.3/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_user_lock_deadlock) error. This error does not cause\ntransactions to roll back.\n\nMySQL enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64 characters.\n ...

[GROUPING]
declaration=expr [, expr] ...
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=For GROUP BY queries that include a WITH ROLLUP modifier, the ROLLUP\noperation produces super-aggregate output rows where NULL represents\nthe set of all values. The GROUPING() function enables you to\ndistinguish NULL values for super-aggregate rows from NULL values in\nregular grouped rows.\n\nGROUPING() is permitted in the select list, HAVING clause, and ORDER BY\nclause.\n\nEach argument to GROUPING() must be an expression that exactly matches\nan expression in the GROUP BY clause. The expression cannot be a\npositional specifier. For each expression, GROUPING() produces 1 if the\nexpression value in the current row is a NULL representing a\nsuper-aggregate value. Otherwise, GROUPING() produces 0, indicating\nthat the expression value is a NULL for a regular result row or is not\nNULL.\n\nSuppose that table t1 contains these rows, where NULL indicates\nsomething like "other" or "unknown":\n\nmysql> SELECT * FROM t1;\n+------+-------+----------+\n| name | size  | quantity |\n+------+-------+----------+\n| ball | small |       10 |\n| ball | large |       20 |\n| ball | NULL  |        5 |\n| hoop | small |       15 |\n| hoop | large |        5 |\n| hoop | NULL  |        3 |\n+------+-------+----------+\n\nA summary of the table without WITH ROLLUP looks like this:\n\nmysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity\n       FROM t1\n       GROUP BY name, size;\n+------+-------+----------+\n| name | size  | quantity |\n+------+-------+----------+\n| ball | small |       10 |\n| ball | large |       20 |\n| ball | NULL  |        5 |\n| hoop | small |       15 |\n| hoop | large |        5 |\n| hoop | NULL  |        3 |\n+------+-------+----------+\n\nThe result contains NULL values, but those do not represent\nsuper-aggregate rows because the query does not include WITH ROLLUP.\n ...

An error\noccurs if the json_doc argument is not a valid JSON document, any path\nargument is not a valid path expression, one_or_all is not 'one' or\n'all', or escape_char is not a constant expression.\n\nThe one_or_all argument affects the search as follows:\n\no 'one': The search terminates after the first match and returns one\n  path string. It is undefined which match is considered first.\n\no 'all': The search returns all matching path strings such that no\n  duplicate paths are included. If there are multiple strings, they are\n  autowrapped as an array. The order of the array elements is\n  undefined.\n\nWithin the search_str search string argument, the % and _ characters\nwork as for the LIKE operator: % matches any number of characters\n(including zero characters), and _ matches exactly one character.\n\nTo specify a literal % or _ character in the search string, precede it\nby the escape character. The default is \ if the escape_char argument\nis missing or NULL. Otherwise, escape_char must be a constant that is\nempty or one character.\n\nFor more information about matching and escape character behavior, see\nthe description of LIKE in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/string-comparison-functions.html\n. For escape character handling, a difference from the LIKE behavior\nis that the escape character for JSON_SEARCH() must evaluate to a\nconstant at compile time, not just at execution time. For example, if\nJSON_SEARCH() is used in a prepared statement and the escape_char\nargument is supplied using a ? parameter, the parameter value might be\nconstant at execution time, but is not at compile time.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/json-search-functions.html

[LAST_INSERT_ID]
declaration=
category=Information Functions
description=With no argument, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns a BIGINT UNSIGNED (64-bit)\nvalue representing the first automatically generated value successfully\ninserted for an AUTO_INCREMENT column as a result of the most recently\nexecuted INSERT statement. The value of LAST_INSERT_ID() remains\nunchanged if no rows are successfully inserted.\n\nWith an argument, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns an unsigned integer, or NULL\nif the argument is NULL.\n\nFor example, after inserting a row that generates an AUTO_INCREMENT\nvalue, you can get the value like this:\n\nmysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();\n        -> 195\n\nThe currently executing statement does not affect the value of\nLAST_INSERT_ID(). Suppose that you generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value\nwith one statement, and then refer to LAST_INSERT_ID() in a\nmultiple-row INSERT statement that inserts rows into a table with its\nown AUTO_INCREMENT column. The value of LAST_INSERT_ID() remains stable\nin the second statement; its value for the second and later rows is not\naffected by the earlier row insertions. (You should be aware that, if\nyou mix references to LAST_INSERT_ID() and LAST_INSERT_ID(expr), the\neffect is undefined.)\n\nIf the previous statement returned an error, the value of\nLAST_INSERT_ID() is undefined. For transactional tables, if the\nstatement is rolled back due to an error, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID()\nis left undefined. For manual ROLLBACK, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID()\nis not restored to that before the transaction; it remains as it was at\nthe point of the ROLLBACK.\n\nWithin the body of a stored routine (procedure or function) or a\ntrigger, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID() changes the same way as for\nstatements executed outside the body of these kinds of objects. The\neffect of a stored routine or trigger upon the value of\nLAST_INSERT_ID() that is seen by following statements depends on the\nkind of routine:\n\no If a stored procedure executes statements that change the value of\n  LAST_INSERT_ID(), the changed value is seen by statements that follow\n  the procedure call.\n\no For stored functions and triggers that change the value, the value is\n  restored when the function or trigger ends, so statements coming\n  after it do not see a changed value.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/information-functions.html

declaration=[N]
category=Numeric Functions
description=Returns a random floating-point value v in the range 0 <= v < 1.0. To\nobtain a random integer R in the range i <= R < j, use the expression\nFLOOR(i + RAND() * (j − i)). For example, to obtain a random integer\nin the range the range 7 <= R < 12, use the following statement:\n\nSELECT FLOOR(7 + (RAND() * 5));\n\nIf an integer argument N is specified, it is used as the seed value:\n\no With a constant initializer argument, the seed is initialized once\n  when the statement is prepared, prior to execution.\n\no With a nonconstant initializer argument (such as a column name), the\n  seed is initialized with the value for each invocation of RAND().\n\nOne implication of this behavior is that for equal argument values,\nRAND(N) returns the same value each time, and thus produces a\nrepeatable sequence of column values. In the following example, the\nsequence of values produced by RAND(3) is the same both places it\noccurs.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/mathematical-functions.html
[RANDOM_BYTES]

description=This function returns a binary string of len random bytes generated\nusing the random number generator of the SSL library. Permitted values\nof len range from 1 to 1024. For values outside that range, an error\noccurs. Returns NULL if len is NULL.\n\nRANDOM_BYTES() can be used to provide the initialization vector for the\nAES_DECRYPT() and AES_ENCRYPT() functions. For use in that context, len\nmust be at least 16. Larger values are permitted, but bytes in excess\nof 16 are ignored.\n\nRANDOM_BYTES() generates a random value, which makes its result\nnondeterministic. Consequently, statements that use this function are\nunsafe for statement-based replication.\n\nIf RANDOM_BYTES() is invoked from within the mysql client, binary\nstrings display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of\nthe --binary-as-hex.

The\npattern need not be a literal string. For example, it can be specified\nas a string expression or table column.\n\nThe optional match_type argument is a string that may contain any or\nall the following characters specifying how to perform matching:\n\no c: Case-sensitive matching.\n\no i: Case-insensitive matching.\n\no m: Multiple-line mode. Recognize line terminators within the string.\n  The default behavior is to match line terminators only at the start\n  and end of the string expression.\n\no n: The . character matches line terminators. The default is for .\n  matching to stop at the end of a line.\n\no u: Unix-only line endings. Only the newline character is recognized\n  as a line ending by the ., ^, and $ match operators.\n\nIf characters specifying contradictory options are specified within\nmatch_type, the rightmost one takes precedence.\n\nBy default, regular expression operations use the character set and\ncollation of the expr and pat arguments when deciding the type of a\ncharacter and performing the comparison. If the arguments have\ndifferent character sets or collations, coercibility rules apply as\ndescribed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/charset-collation-coercibility.\nhtml.

If you specify the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag to\nmysql_real_connect()\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.2/en/mysql-real-connect.html) when\nconnecting to mysqld, the affected-rows value is the number of rows\n"found"; that is, matched by the WHERE clause.\n\nFor REPLACE statements, the affected-rows value is 2 if the new row\nreplaced an old row, because in this case, one row was inserted after\nthe duplicate was deleted.\n\nFor INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements, the affected-rows\nvalue per row is 1 if the row is inserted as a new row, 2 if an\nexisting row is updated, and 0 if an existing row is set to its current\nvalues. If you specify the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag, the affected-rows\nvalue is 1 (not 0) if an existing row is set to its current values.\n\nThe ROW_COUNT() value is similar to the value from the\nmysql_affected_rows()\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.2/en/mysql-affected-rows.html) C API\nfunction and the row count that the mysql client displays following\nstatement execution.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/information-functions.html

[SOUNDEX]
declaration=str
category=String Functions
description=Returns a soundex string from str, or NULL if str is NULL. Two strings\nthat sound almost the same should have identical soundex strings. A\nstandard soundex string is four characters long, but the SOUNDEX()\nfunction returns an arbitrarily long string. You can use SUBSTRING() on\nthe result to get a standard soundex string. All nonalphabetic\ncharacters in str are ignored. All international alphabetic characters\noutside the A-Z range are treated as vowels.\n\n*Important*:\n\nWhen using SOUNDEX(), you should be aware of the following limitations:\n\no This function, as currently implemented, is intended to work well\n  with strings that are in the English language only. Strings in other\n  languages may not produce reliable results.\n\no This function is not guaranteed to provide consistent results with\n  strings that use multibyte character sets, including utf-8.

[SOURCE_POS_WAIT]
declaration=log_name,log_pos[,timeout][,channel]
category=GTID
description=This function is for control of source-replica synchronization. It\nblocks until the replica has read and applied all updates up to the\nspecified position in the source's binary log.\n\nThe return value is the number of log events the replica had to wait\nfor to advance to the specified position. The function returns NULL if\nthe replication SQL thread is not started, the replica's source\ninformation is not initialized, the arguments are incorrect, or an\nerror occurs. It returns -1 if the timeout has been exceeded. If the\nreplication SQL thread stops while SOURCE_POS_WAIT() is waiting, the\nfunction returns NULL. If the replica is past the specified position,\nthe function returns immediately.\n\nIf the binary log file position has been marked as invalid, the\nfunction waits until a valid file position is known. The binary log\nfile position can be marked as invalid when the CHANGE REPLICATION\nSOURCE TO option GTID_ONLY is set for the replication channel, and the\nserver is restarted or replication is stopped. The file position\nbecomes valid after a transaction is successfully applied past the\ngiven file position. If the applier does not reach the stated position,\nthe function waits until the timeout. Use a SHOW REPLICA STATUS\nstatement to check if the binary log file position has been marked as\ninvalid.\n\nOn a multithreaded replica, the function waits until expiry of the\nlimit set by the replica_checkpoint_group or replica_checkpoint_period\nsystem variable, when the checkpoint operation is called to update the\nstatus of the replica. Depending on the setting for the system\nvariables, the function might therefore return some time after the\nspecified position was reached.\n\nIf binary log transaction compression is in use and the transaction\npayload at the specified position is compressed (as a\nTransaction_payload_event), the function waits until the whole\ntransaction has been read and applied, and the positions have updated.\n\nIf a timeout value is specified, SOURCE_POS_WAIT() stops waiting when\ntimeout seconds have elapsed. timeout must be greater than or equal to\n0. (When the server is running in strict SQL mode, a negative timeout\nvalue is immediately rejected with ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.3/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_wrong_arguments); otherwise the function returns NULL, and\nraises a warning.)\n\nThe optional channel value enables you to name which replication\nchannel the function applies to.

declaration=[fsp]
category=Date and Time Functions
description=Returns the current date and time as a value in 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'\nor YYYYMMDDhhmmss format, depending on whether the function is used in\nstring or numeric context.\n\nIf the fsp argument is given to specify a fractional seconds precision\nfrom 0 to 6, the return value includes a fractional seconds part of\nthat many digits.\n\nSYSDATE() returns the time at which it executes. This differs from the\nbehavior for NOW(), which returns a constant time that indicates the\ntime at which the statement began to execute. (Within a stored function\nor trigger, NOW() returns the time at which the function or triggering\nstatement began to execute.)\n\nmysql> SELECT NOW(), SLEEP(2), NOW();\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| NOW()               | SLEEP(2) | NOW()               |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| 2006-04-12 13:47:36 |        0 | 2006-04-12 13:47:36 |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n\nmysql> SELECT SYSDATE(), SLEEP(2), SYSDATE();\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| SYSDATE()           | SLEEP(2) | SYSDATE()           |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| 2006-04-12 13:47:44 |        0 | 2006-04-12 13:47:46 |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n\nIn addition, the SET TIMESTAMP statement affects the value returned by\nNOW() but not by SYSDATE(). This means that timestamp settings in the\nbinary log have no effect on invocations of SYSDATE().\n\nBecause SYSDATE() can return different values even within the same\nstatement, and is not affected by SET TIMESTAMP, it is nondeterministic\nand therefore unsafe for replication if statement-based binary logging\nis used. If that is a problem, you can use row-based logging.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the --sysdate-is-now option to cause\nSYSDATE() to be an alias for NOW(). This works if the option is used on\nboth the replication source server and the replica.\n\nThe nondeterministic nature of SYSDATE() also means that indexes cannot\nbe used for evaluating expressions that refer to it.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/date-and-time-functions.html

description=TIMEDIFF() returns expr1 − expr2 expressed as a time value. expr1 and\nexpr2 are strings which are converted to TIME or DATETIME expressions;\nthese must be of the same type following conversion. Returns NULL if\nexpr1 or expr2 is NULL.\n\nThe result returned by TIMEDIFF() is limited to the range allowed for\nTIME values.

[TIMESTAMP]
declaration=fsp

TIMESTAMP values are stored as the\nnumber of seconds since the epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). A\nTIMESTAMP cannot represent the value '1970-01-01 00:00:00' because that\nis equivalent to 0 seconds from the epoch and the value 0 is reserved\nfor representing '0000-00-00 00:00:00', the "zero" TIMESTAMP value.\n\nAn optional fsp value in the range from 0 to 6 may be given to specify\nfractional seconds precision. A value of 0 signifies that there is no\nfractional part. If omitted, the default precision is 0.\n\nThe way the server handles TIMESTAMP definitions depends on the value\nof the explicit_defaults_for_timestamp system variable (see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/server-system-variables.html).\n\nIf explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is enabled, there is no automatic\nassignment of the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE\nCURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes to any TIMESTAMP column. They must be\nincluded explicitly in the column definition. Also, any TIMESTAMP not\nexplicitly declared as NOT NULL permits NULL values.\n\nIf explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled, the server handles\nTIMESTAMP as follows:\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the first TIMESTAMP column in a table is\ndefined to be automatically set to the date and time of the most recent\nmodification if not explicitly assigned a value. This makes TIMESTAMP\nuseful for recording the timestamp of an INSERT or UPDATE operation.\nYou can also set any TIMESTAMP column to the current date and time by\nassigning it a NULL value, unless it has been defined with the NULL\nattribute to permit NULL values.\n\nAutomatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can\nbe specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE\nCURRENT_TIMESTAMP column definition clauses. By default, the first\nTIMESTAMP column has these properties, as previously noted. However,\nany TIMESTAMP column in a table can be defined to have these\nproperties.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/date-and-time-type-syntax.html

declaration=[date]
category=Date and Time Functions
description=If UNIX_TIMESTAMP() is called with no date argument, it returns a Unix\ntimestamp representing seconds since '1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC.\n\nIf UNIX_TIMESTAMP() is called with a date argument, it returns the\nvalue of the argument as seconds since '1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC. The\nserver interprets date as a value in the session time zone and converts\nit to an internal Unix timestamp value in UTC. (Clients can set the\nsession time zone as described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/time-zone-support.html.) The\ndate argument may be a DATE, DATETIME, or TIMESTAMP string, or a number\nin YYMMDD, YYMMDDhhmmss, YYYYMMDD, or YYYYMMDDhhmmss format. If the\nargument includes a time part, it may optionally include a fractional\nseconds part.\n\nThe return value is an integer if no argument is given or the argument\ndoes not include a fractional seconds part, or DECIMAL if an argument\nis given that includes a fractional seconds part.\n\nWhen the date argument is a TIMESTAMP column, UNIX_TIMESTAMP() returns\nthe internal timestamp value directly, with no implicit\n"string-to-Unix-timestamp" conversion.\n\nThe valid range of argument values is the same as for the TIMESTAMP\ndata type: '1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000' UTC to '2038-01-19\n03:14:07.999999' UTC for 32-bit platforms; for MySQL running on 64-bit\nplatforms, the valid range of argument values for UNIX_TIMESTAMP() is\n'1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000' UTC to '3001-01-19 03:14:07.999999' UTC\n(corresponding to 32536771199.999999 seconds).\n\nRegardless of MySQL version or platform architecture, if you pass an\nout-of-range date to UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), it returns 0.

[UUID]
declaration=
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=Returns a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) generated according to RFC\n4122, "A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"\n(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt).\n\nA UUID is designed as a number that is globally unique in space and\ntime. Two calls to UUID() are expected to generate two different\nvalues, even if these calls are performed on two separate devices not\nconnected to each other.\n\n*Warning*:\n\nAlthough UUID() values are intended to be unique, they are not\nnecessarily unguessable or unpredictable. If unpredictability is\nrequired, UUID values should be generated some other way.\n\nUUID() returns a value that conforms to UUID version 1 as described in\nRFC 4122. The value is a 128-bit number represented as a utf8mb3 string\nof five hexadecimal numbers in aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee\nformat:\n\no The first three numbers are generated from the low, middle, and high\n  parts of a timestamp. The high part also includes the UUID version\n  number.\n\no The fourth number preserves temporal uniqueness in case the timestamp\n  value loses monotonicity (for example, due to daylight saving time).\n\no The fifth number is an IEEE 802 node number that provides spatial\n  uniqueness. A random number is substituted if the latter is not\n  available (for example, because the host device has no Ethernet card,\n  or it is unknown how to find the hardware address of an interface on\n  the host operating system). In this case, spatial uniqueness cannot\n  be guaranteed. Nevertheless, a collision should have very low\n  probability.\n\n  The MAC address of an interface is taken into account only on\n  FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows. On other operating systems, MySQL uses a\n  randomly generated 48-bit number.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/miscellaneous-functions.html
[UUID_SHORT]

The value of UUID_SHORT() is guaranteed to be\nunique if the following conditions hold:\n\no The server_id value of the current server is between 0 and 255 and is\n  unique among your set of source and replica servers\n\no You do not set back the system time for your server host between\n  mysqld restarts\n\no You invoke UUID_SHORT() on average fewer than 16 million times per\n  second between mysqld restarts\n\nThe UUID_SHORT() return value is constructed this way:\n\n  (server_id & 255) << 56\n+ (server_startup_time_in_seconds << 24)\n+ incremented_variable++;\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/miscellaneous-functions.html
[UUID_TO_BIN]
declaration=string_uuid
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=Converts a string UUID to a binary UUID and returns the result. (The\nIS_UUID() function description lists the permitted string UUID\nformats.) The return binary UUID is a VARBINARY(16) value. If the UUID\nargument is NULL, the return value is NULL. If any argument is invalid,\nan error occurs.\n\nUUID_TO_BIN() takes one or two arguments:\n\no The one-argument form takes a string UUID value. The binary result is\n  in the same order as the string argument.\n\no The two-argument form takes a string UUID value and a flag value:\n\n  o If swap_flag is 0, the two-argument form is equivalent to the\n    one-argument form. The binary result is in the same order as the\n    string argument.\n\n  o If swap_flag is 1, the format of the return value differs: The\n    time-low and time-high parts (the first and third groups of\n    hexadecimal digits, respectively) are swapped. This moves the more\n    rapidly varying part to the right and can improve indexing\n    efficiency if the result is stored in an indexed column.\n\nTime-part swapping assumes the use of UUID version 1 values, such as\nare generated by the UUID() function. For UUID values produced by other\nmeans that do not follow version 1 format, time-part swapping provides\nno benefit. For details about version 1 format, see the UUID() function\ndescription.\n\nSuppose that you have the following string UUID value:\n\nmysql> SET @uuid = '6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db';\n\nTo convert the string UUID to binary with or without time-part\nswapping, use UUID_TO_BIN():\n\nmysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid));\n+----------------------------------+\n| HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid))          |\n+----------------------------------+\n| 6CCD780CBABA102695645B8C656024DB |\n+----------------------------------+\nmysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 0));\n+----------------------------------+\n| HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 0))       |\n+----------------------------------+\n| 6CCD780CBABA102695645B8C656024DB |\n+----------------------------------+\nmysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 1));\n+----------------------------------+\n ...

[VARCHAR]
declaration=M
category=Data Types
description=collation_name]\n\nA variable-length string. M represents the maximum column length in\ncharacters. The range of M is 0 to 65,535. The effective maximum length\nof a VARCHAR is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is\nshared among all columns) and the character set used. For example,\nutf8mb3 characters can require up to three bytes per character, so a\nVARCHAR column that uses the utf8mb3 character set can be declared to\nbe a maximum of 21,844 characters. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/column-count-limit.html.\n\nMySQL stores VARCHAR values as a 1-byte or 2-byte length prefix plus\ndata. The length prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. A\nVARCHAR column uses one length byte if values require no more than 255\nbytes, two length bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes.\n\n*Note*:\n\nMySQL follows the standard SQL specification, and does not remove\ntrailing spaces from VARCHAR values.\n\nVARCHAR is shorthand for CHARACTER VARYING. NATIONAL VARCHAR is the\nstandard SQL way to define that a VARCHAR column should use some\npredefined character set. MySQL uses utf8mb3 as this predefined\ncharacter set.\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/charset-national.html.

If the input is a\nnonbinary (character) string such as a CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT value,\nthe return value contains the collation weights for the string. If the\ninput is a binary (byte) string such as a BINARY, VARBINARY, or BLOB\nvalue, the return value is the same as the input (the weight for each\nbyte in a binary string is the byte value). If the input is NULL,\nWEIGHT_STRING() returns NULL.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> SET @s = _utf8mb4 'AB' COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| AB   | 4142    | 1C471C60               |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nmysql> SET @s = _utf8mb4 'ab' COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n ...

[YEARWEEK]
declaration=date
category=Date and Time Functions
description=Returns year and week for a date. The year in the result may be\ndifferent from the year in the date argument for the first and the last\nweek of the year. Returns NULL if date is NULL.\n\nThe mode argument works exactly like the mode argument to WEEK(). For\nthe single-argument syntax, a mode value of 0 is used. Unlike WEEK(),\nthe value of default_week_format does not influence YEARWEEK().\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/date-and-time-functions.html
