[AES_DECRYPT]
declaration=crypt_str,key_str[,init_vector]
category=Encryption Functions
description=This function decrypts data using the official AES (Advanced Encryption\nStandard) algorithm. For more information, see the description of\nAES_ENCRYPT().\n\nThe optional initialization vector argument, init_vector, is available\nas of MySQL 5.7.4.

[AES_ENCRYPT]
declaration=str,key_str[,init_vector]
category=Encryption Functions
description=AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() implement encryption and decryption of\ndata using the official AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm,\npreviously known as "Rijndael." The AES standard permits various key\nlengths. By default these functions implement AES with a 128-bit key\nlength. As of MySQL 5.7.4, key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be used,\nas described later. The key length is a trade off between performance\nand security.\n\nAES_ENCRYPT() encrypts the string str using the key string key_str and\nreturns a binary string containing the encrypted output. AES_DECRYPT()\ndecrypts the encrypted string crypt_str using the key string key_str\nand returns the original plaintext string. If either function argument\nis NULL, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe str and crypt_str arguments can be any length, and padding is\nautomatically added to str so it is a multiple of a block as required\nby block-based algorithms such as AES. This padding is automatically\nremoved by the AES_DECRYPT() function. The length of crypt_str can be\ncalculated using this formula:\n\n16 * (trunc(string_length / 16) + 1)\n\nFor a key length of 128 bits, the most secure way to pass a key to the\nkey_str argument is to create a truly random 128-bit value and pass it\nas a binary value. For example:\n\nINSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text',UNHEX('F3229A0B371ED2D9441B830D21A390C3')));\n\nA passphrase can be used to generate an AES key by hashing the\npassphrase. For example:\n\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text', SHA2('My secret passphrase',512)));\n\nDo not pass a password or passphrase directly to crypt_str, hash it\nfirst. Previous versions of this documentation suggested the former\napproach, but it is no longer recommended as the examples shown here\nare more secure.\n\nIf AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it returns\nNULL. However, it is possible for AES_DECRYPT() to return a non-NULL\nvalue (possibly garbage) if the input data or the key is invalid.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.7.4, AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() permit control of\nthe block encryption mode and take an optional init_vector\ninitialization vector argument:\n\no The block_encryption_mode system variable controls the mode for\n  block-based encryption algorithms. Its default value is aes-128-ecb,\n  which signifies encryption using a key length of 128 bits and ECB\n ...
[ANY_VALUE]
declaration=arg
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=This function is useful for GROUP BY queries when the\nONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode is enabled, for cases when MySQL rejects a\nquery that you know is valid for reasons that MySQL cannot determine.\nThe function return value and type are the same as the return value and\ntype of its argument, but the function result is not checked for the\nONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode.\n\nFor example, if name is a nonindexed column, the following query fails\nwith ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled:\n\nmysql> SELECT name, address, MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;\nERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP\nBY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.address' which\nis not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this\nis incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by\n\nThe failure occurs because address is a nonaggregated column that is\nneither named among GROUP BY columns nor functionally dependent on\nthem. As a result, the address value for rows within each name group is\nnondeterministic. There are multiple ways to cause MySQL to accept the\nquery:\n\no Alter the table to make name a primary key or a unique NOT NULL\n  column. This enables MySQL to determine that address is functionally\n  dependent on name; that is, address is uniquely determined by name.\n  (This technique is inapplicable if NULL must be permitted as a valid\n  name value.)\n\no Use ANY_VALUE() to refer to address:\n\nSELECT name, ANY_VALUE(address), MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;\n\n  In this case, MySQL ignores the nondeterminism of address values\n  within each name group and accepts the query. This may be useful if\n  you simply do not care which value of a nonaggregated column is\n  chosen for each group. ANY_VALUE() is not an aggregate function,\n  unlike functions such as SUM() or COUNT(). It simply acts to suppress\n  the test for nondeterminism.\n\no Disable ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY. This is equivalent to using ANY_VALUE()\n  with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled, as described in the previous item.\n\nANY_VALUE() is also useful if functional dependence exists between\ncolumns but MySQL cannot determine it. The following query is valid\nbecause age is functionally dependent on the grouping column age-1, but\nMySQL cannot tell that and rejects the query with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY\nenabled:\n\nSELECT age FROM t GROUP BY age-1;\n\n ...

For this to work, the user must have the\nSUPER privilege. The key file can be specified with the --des-key-file\nserver option.\n\nIf you pass this function a key_str argument, that string is used as\nthe key for decrypting the message.\n\nIf the crypt_str argument does not appear to be an encrypted string,\nMySQL returns the given crypt_str.\n\n*Note*: The DES_ENCRYPT() and DES_DECRYPT() functions are deprecated as\nof MySQL 5.7.6, will be removed in a future MySQL release, and should\nno longer be used.

description=Encrypts the string with the given key using the Triple-DES algorithm.\n\nThis function works only if MySQL has been configured with SSL support.\nSee http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/ssl-connections.html.\n\nThe encryption key to use is chosen based on the second argument to\nDES_ENCRYPT(), if one was given. With no argument, the first key from\nthe DES key file is used. With a key_num argument, the given key number\n(0 to 9) from the DES key file is used. With a key_str argument, the\ngiven key string is used to encrypt str.\n\nThe key file can be specified with the --des-key-file server option.\n\nThe return string is a binary string where the first character is\nCHAR(128 | key_num). If an error occurs, DES_ENCRYPT() returns NULL.\n\nThe 128 is added to make it easier to recognize an encrypted key. If\nyou use a string key, key_num is 127.\n\nThe string length for the result is given by this formula:\n\nnew_len = orig_len + (8 - (orig_len % 8)) + 1\n\nEach line in the DES key file has the following format:\n\nkey_num des_key_str\n\nEach key_num value must be a number in the range from 0 to 9. Lines in\nthe file may be in any order. des_key_str is the string that is used to\nencrypt the message. There should be at least one space between the\nnumber and the key. The first key is the default key that is used if\nyou do not specify any key argument to DES_ENCRYPT().\n\nYou can tell MySQL to read new key values from the key file with the\nFLUSH DES_KEY_FILE statement. This requires the RELOAD privilege.\n\nOne benefit of having a set of default keys is that it gives\napplications a way to check for the existence of encrypted column\nvalues, without giving the end user the right to decrypt those values.\n\n*Note*: The DES_ENCRYPT() and DES_DECRYPT() functions are deprecated as\nof MySQL 5.7.6, will be removed in a future MySQL release, and should\nno longer be used.

description=ExtractValue() takes two string arguments, a fragment of XML markup\nxml_frag and an XPath expression xpath_expr (also known as a locator);\nit returns the text (CDATA) of the first text node which is a child of\nthe elements or elements matched by the XPath expression.\n\nUsing this function is the equivalent of performing a match using the\nxpath_expr after appending /text(). In other words,\nExtractValue('<a><b>Sakila</b></a>', '/a/b') and\nExtractValue('<a><b>Sakila</b></a>', '/a/b/text()') produce the same\nresult.\n\nIf multiple matches are found, the content of the first child text node\nof each matching element is returned (in the order matched) as a\nsingle, space-delimited string.\n\nIf no matching text node is found for the expression (including the\nimplicit /text())---for whatever reason, as long as xpath_expr is\nvalid, and xml_frag consists of elements which are properly nested and\nclosed---an empty string is returned. No distinction is made between a\nmatch on an empty element and no match at all. This is by design.\n\nIf you need to determine whether no matching element was found in\nxml_frag or such an element was found but contained no child text\nnodes, you should test the result of an expression that uses the XPath\ncount() function. For example, both of these statements return an empty\nstring, as shown here:\n\nmysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', '/a/b');\n+-------------------------------------+\n| ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', '/a/b') |\n+-------------------------------------+\n|                                     |\n+-------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', '/a/b');\n+-------------------------------------+\n| ExtractValue('<a><c/></a>', '/a/b') |\n+-------------------------------------+\n|                                     |\n+-------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nHowever, you can determine whether there was actually a matching\nelement using the following:\n\nmysql> SELECT ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', 'count(/a/b)');\n+-------------------------------------+\n| ExtractValue('<a><b/></a>', 'count(/a/b)') |\n+-------------------------------------+\n ...

[GET_LOCK]
declaration=str,timeout
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string str, using a\ntimeout of timeout seconds. A negative timeout value means infinite\ntimeout.\n\nReturns 1 if the lock was obtained successfully, 0 if the attempt timed\nout (for example, because another client has previously locked the\nname), or NULL if an error occurred (such as running out of memory or\nthe thread was killed with mysqladmin kill). If you have a lock\nobtained with GET_LOCK(), it is released when you execute\nRELEASE_LOCK() or your connection terminates (either normally or\nabnormally). Lock release may also occur with another call to\nGET_LOCK():\n\no Before 5.7.5, only a single simultaneous lock can be acquired and\n  GET_LOCK() releases any existing lock.\n\no In MySQL 5.7.5, GET_LOCK() was reimplemented using the metadata\n  locking (MDL) subsystem and its capabilities were extended. Multiple\n  simultaneous locks can be acquired and GET_LOCK() does not release\n  any existing locks. It is even possible for a given session to\n  acquire multiple locks for the same name. Other sessions cannot\n  acquire a lock with that name until the acquiring session releases\n  all its locks for the name.\n\n  As a result of the MDL reimplementation, locks acquired with\n  GET_LOCK() appear in the Performance Schema metadata_locks table. The\n  OBJECT_TYPE column says USER LEVEL LOCK and the OBJECT_NAME column\n  indicates the lock name. Also, the capability of acquiring multiple\n  locks introduces the possibility of deadlock among clients. An\n  ER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK error is returned when this occurs.\n\nThe difference in lock acquisition behavior as of MySQL 5.7.5 can be\nseen by the following example. Suppose that you execute these\nstatements:\n\nSELECT GET_LOCK('lock1',10);\nSELECT GET_LOCK('lock2',10);\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock2');\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock1');\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.5 or later, the second GET_LOCK() acquires a second lock\nand both RELEASE_LOCK() calls return 1 (success). Before MySQL 5.7.5,\nthe second GET_LOCK() releases the first lock ('lock1') and the second\nRELEASE_LOCK() returns NULL (failure) because there is no 'lock1' to\nrelease.\n\nMySQL 5.7.5 and later enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64\ncharacters. Previously, no limit was enforced.\n\nLocks obtained with GET_LOCK() do not interact with transactions. That\n ...

[LAST_INSERT_ID]
declaration=
category=Information Functions
description=With no argument, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns a BIGINT UNSIGNED (64-bit)\nvalue representing the first automatically generated value successfully\ninserted for an AUTO_INCREMENT column as a result of the most recently\nexecuted INSERT statement. The value of LAST_INSERT_ID() remains\nunchanged if no rows are successfully inserted.\n\nWith an argument, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns an unsigned integer.\n\nFor example, after inserting a row that generates an AUTO_INCREMENT\nvalue, you can get the value like this:\n\nmysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();\n        -> 195\n\nThe currently executing statement does not affect the value of\nLAST_INSERT_ID(). Suppose that you generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value\nwith one statement, and then refer to LAST_INSERT_ID() in a\nmultiple-row INSERT statement that inserts rows into a table with its\nown AUTO_INCREMENT column. The value of LAST_INSERT_ID() will remain\nstable in the second statement; its value for the second and later rows\nis not affected by the earlier row insertions. (However, if you mix\nreferences to LAST_INSERT_ID() and LAST_INSERT_ID(expr), the effect is\nundefined.)\n\nIf the previous statement returned an error, the value of\nLAST_INSERT_ID() is undefined. For transactional tables, if the\nstatement is rolled back due to an error, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID()\nis left undefined. For manual ROLLBACK, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID()\nis not restored to that before the transaction; it remains as it was at\nthe point of the ROLLBACK.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.3, this function was not replicated correctly if\nreplication filtering rules were in use. (Bug #17234370, Bug #69861)\n\nWithin the body of a stored routine (procedure or function) or a\ntrigger, the value of LAST_INSERT_ID() changes the same way as for\nstatements executed outside the body of these kinds of objects. The\neffect of a stored routine or trigger upon the value of\nLAST_INSERT_ID() that is seen by following statements depends on the\nkind of routine:\n\no If a stored procedure executes statements that change the value of\n  LAST_INSERT_ID(), the changed value is seen by statements that follow\n  the procedure call.\n\no For stored functions and triggers that change the value, the value is\n  restored when the function or trigger ends, so following statements\n  will not see a changed value.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-functions.html

This\n  applies to statements such as UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE (as before),\n  but now also to statements such as ALTER TABLE and LOAD DATA INFILE.\n\no SELECT: -1 if the statement returns a result set, or the number of\n  rows "affected" if it does not. For example, for SELECT * FROM t1,\n  ROW_COUNT() returns -1. For SELECT * FROM t1 INTO OUTFILE\n  'file_name', ROW_COUNT() returns the number of rows written to the\n  file.\n\no SIGNAL statements: 0.\n\nFor UPDATE statements, the affected-rows value by default is the number\nof rows actually changed. If you specify the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag to\nmysql_real_connect() when connecting to mysqld, the affected-rows value\nis the number of rows "found"; that is, matched by the WHERE clause.\n\nFor REPLACE statements, the affected-rows value is 2 if the new row\nreplaced an old row, because in this case, one row was inserted after\nthe duplicate was deleted.\n\nFor INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements, the affected-rows\nvalue per row is 1 if the row is inserted as a new row, 2 if an\nexisting row is updated, and 0 if an existing row is set to its current\nvalues. If you specify the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag, the affected-rows\nvalue is 1 (not 0) if an existing row is set to its current values.\n\nThe ROW_COUNT() value is similar to the value from the\nmysql_affected_rows() C API function and the row count that the mysql\nclient displays following statement execution.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-functions.html

description=This is the inverse of the DATE_FORMAT() function. It takes a string\nstr and a format string format. STR_TO_DATE() returns a DATETIME value\nif the format string contains both date and time parts, or a DATE or\nTIME value if the string contains only date or time parts. If the date,\ntime, or datetime value extracted from str is illegal, STR_TO_DATE()\nreturns NULL and produces a warning.\n\nThe server scans str attempting to match format to it. The format\nstring can contain literal characters and format specifiers beginning\nwith %. Literal characters in format must match literally in str.\nFormat specifiers in format must match a date or time part in str.

Before 5.6.4, any argument is ignored.\n\nSYSDATE() returns the time at which it executes. This differs from the\nbehavior for NOW(), which returns a constant time that indicates the\ntime at which the statement began to execute. (Within a stored function\nor trigger, NOW() returns the time at which the function or triggering\nstatement began to execute.)\n\nmysql> SELECT NOW(), SLEEP(2), NOW();\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| NOW()               | SLEEP(2) | NOW()               |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| 2006-04-12 13:47:36 |        0 | 2006-04-12 13:47:36 |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n\nmysql> SELECT SYSDATE(), SLEEP(2), SYSDATE();\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| SYSDATE()           | SLEEP(2) | SYSDATE()           |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n| 2006-04-12 13:47:44 |        0 | 2006-04-12 13:47:46 |\n+---------------------+----------+---------------------+\n\nIn addition, the SET TIMESTAMP statement affects the value returned by\nNOW() but not by SYSDATE(). This means that timestamp settings in the\nbinary log have no effect on invocations of SYSDATE().\n\nBecause SYSDATE() can return different values even within the same\nstatement, and is not affected by SET TIMESTAMP, it is nondeterministic\nand therefore unsafe for replication if statement-based binary logging\nis used. If that is a problem, you can use row-based logging.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the --sysdate-is-now option to cause\nSYSDATE() to be an alias for NOW(). This works if the option is used on\nboth the master and the slave.\n\nThe nondeterministic nature of SYSDATE() also means that indexes cannot\nbe used for evaluating expressions that refer to it.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html

A\nTIMESTAMP cannot represent the value '1970-01-01 00:00:00' because that\nis equivalent to 0 seconds from the epoch and the value 0 is reserved\nfor representing '0000-00-00 00:00:00', the "zero" TIMESTAMP value.\n\nAn optional fsp value in the range from 0 to 6 may be given to specify\nfractional seconds precision. A value of 0 signifies that there is no\nfractional part. If omitted, the default precision is 0.\n\nThe way the server handles TIMESTAMP definitions depends on the value\nof the explicit_defaults_for_timestamp system variable (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html).\nBy default, explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled and the server\nhandles TIMESTAMP as follows:\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the first TIMESTAMP column in a table is\ndefined to be automatically set to the date and time of the most recent\nmodification if not explicitly assigned a value. This makes TIMESTAMP\nuseful for recording the timestamp of an INSERT or UPDATE operation.\nYou can also set any TIMESTAMP column to the current date and time by\nassigning it a NULL value, unless it has been defined with the NULL\nattribute to permit NULL values.\n\nAutomatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can\nbe specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE\nCURRENT_TIMESTAMP column definition clauses. By default, the first\nTIMESTAMP column has these properties, as previously noted. However,\nany TIMESTAMP column in a table can be defined to have these\nproperties.\n\nIf explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is enabled, there is no automatic\nassignment of the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE\nCURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes to any TIMESTAMP column. They must be\nincluded explicitly in the column definition. Also, any TIMESTAMP not\nexplicitly declared as NOT NULL permits NULL values.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-type-overview.html

[UUID]
declaration=
category=Miscellaneous Functions
description=Returns a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) generated according to\n"DCE 1.1: Remote Procedure Call" (Appendix A) CAE (Common Applications\nEnvironment) Specifications published by The Open Group in October 1997\n(Document Number C706,\nhttp://www.opengroup.org/public/pubs/catalog/c706.htm).\n\nA UUID is designed as a number that is globally unique in space and\ntime. Two calls to UUID() are expected to generate two different\nvalues, even if these calls are performed on two separate computers\nthat are not connected to each other.\n\nA UUID is a 128-bit number represented by a utf8 string of five\nhexadecimal numbers in aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee format:\n\no The first three numbers are generated from a timestamp.\n\no The fourth number preserves temporal uniqueness in case the timestamp\n  value loses monotonicity (for example, due to daylight saving time).\n\no The fifth number is an IEEE 802 node number that provides spatial\n  uniqueness. A random number is substituted if the latter is not\n  available (for example, because the host computer has no Ethernet\n  card, or we do not know how to find the hardware address of an\n  interface on your operating system). In this case, spatial uniqueness\n  cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, a collision should have very low\n  probability.\n\n  Currently, the MAC address of an interface is taken into account only\n  on FreeBSD and Linux. On other operating systems, MySQL uses a\n  randomly generated 48-bit number.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/miscellaneous-functions.html

[VALUES]
declaration=col_name
category=Miscellaneous Functions

In other words,\nVALUES(col_name) in the UPDATE clause refers to the value of col_name\nthat would be inserted, had no duplicate-key conflict occurred. This\nfunction is especially useful in multiple-row inserts. The VALUES()\nfunction is meaningful only in the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause of\nINSERT statements and returns NULL otherwise.

[VARBINARY]
declaration=M
category=Data Types
description=The VARBINARY type is similar to the VARCHAR type, but stores binary\nbyte strings rather than nonbinary character strings. M represents the\nmaximum column length in bytes.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-type-overview.html
[VARCHAR]
declaration=M
category=Data Types
description=collation_name]\n\nA variable-length string. M represents the maximum column length in\ncharacters. The range of M is 0 to 65,535. The effective maximum length\nof a VARCHAR is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is\nshared among all columns) and the character set used. For example, utf8\ncharacters can require up to three bytes per character, so a VARCHAR\ncolumn that uses the utf8 character set can be declared to be a maximum\nof 21,844 characters. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/column-count-limit.html.\n\nMySQL stores VARCHAR values as a 1-byte or 2-byte length prefix plus\ndata. The length prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. A\nVARCHAR column uses one length byte if values require no more than 255\nbytes, two length bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes.\n\n*Note*: MySQL 5.7 follows the standard SQL specification, and does not\nremove trailing spaces from VARCHAR values.\n\nVARCHAR is shorthand for CHARACTER VARYING. NATIONAL VARCHAR is the\nstandard SQL way to define that a VARCHAR column should use some\npredefined character set. MySQL 4.1 and up uses utf8 as this predefined\ncharacter set.\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-national.html.

[VAR_POP]
declaration=expr
category=Functions and Modifiers for Use with GROUP BY
description=Returns the population standard variance of expr. It considers rows as\nthe whole population, not as a sample, so it has the number of rows as\nthe denominator. You can also use VARIANCE(), which is equivalent but\nis not standard SQL.\n\nVAR_POP() returns NULL if there were no matching rows.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-functions.html
[VAR_SAMP]

[WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET]
declaration=gtid_set[, timeout]
category=MBR
description=Introduced in MySQL 5.7.5, WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET() is similar to\nWAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS() in that it waits until a server has\nexecuted all of the transactions whose global transaction identifiers\nare contained in gtid_set, or until timeout seconds have elapsed,\nwhichever occurs first. Unlike WAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS(),\nWAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET() does not take into account whether the\nslave is running or not, and an error is returned if GTID-based\nreplication is not enabled.\n\nIn addition, WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET() returns only the state of the\nquery, where 0 represents success, 1 represents timeout, and any other\nfailures return the error message.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/gtid-functions.html
[WAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS]

[WEIGHT_STRING]
declaration=str [AS {CHAR|BINARY}(N
category=String Functions
description=levels: N [ASC|DESC|REVERSE] [, N [ASC|DESC|REVERSE]] ...\n\nThis function returns the weight string for the input string. The\nreturn value is a binary string that represents the sorting and\ncomparison value of the string. It has these properties:\n\no If WEIGHT_STRING(str1) = WEIGHT_STRING(str2), then str1 = str2 (str1\n  and str2 are considered equal)\n\no If WEIGHT_STRING(str1) < WEIGHT_STRING(str2), then str1 < str2 (str1\n  sorts before str2)\n\nWEIGHT_STRING() can be used for testing and debugging of collations,\nespecially if you are adding a new collation. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/adding-collation.html.\n\nThe input string, str, is a string expression. If the input is a\nnonbinary (character) string such as a CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT value,\nthe return value contains the collation weights for the string. If the\ninput is a binary (byte) string such as a BINARY, VARBINARY, or BLOB\nvalue, the return value is the same as the input (the weight for each\nbyte in a binary string is the byte value). If the input is NULL,\nWEIGHT_STRING() returns NULL.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> SET @s = _latin1 'AB' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| AB   | 4142    | 4142                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nmysql> SET @s = _latin1 'ab' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| ab   | 6162    | 4142                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nmysql> SET @s = CAST('AB' AS BINARY);\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| AB   | 4142    | 4142                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\n ...
