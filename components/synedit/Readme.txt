This is version 2.0.3 of the SynEdit project.

SynEdit has been started as an attempt to continue the no longer maintained
sources of the mwEdit project.  The last public version 0.92a of mwEdit can be
found at the SynEdit website in the download section.
The mwEdit project was started in 1998 by Martin Waldenburg, aim was to produce
a syntax highlighting editor component for an Open Source IDE.  In the 15 months
that mwEdit was developped in public Martin was increasingly dissatisfied with
the direction the development of mwEdit took, so he finally requested that his
name and initials had to be removed from the project.
Therefore this is now called SynEdit, and it is an Open Source project under the
MPL (Mozilla Public License, but see the individual source files for the terms).
There would however be no such project if Martin had not started to develop
mwEdit, so we would like to thank Martin Waldenburg for his efforts, and of
course all the other developers of the mwEdit project.

The primary purpose of SynEdit is to be a syntax highlighting editor for
programming languages. There are already more than 30 highlighter components for
different languages, and writing a highlighter is not very difficult.

You should however keep in mind that the SynEdit components you have just 
downloaded have the following shortcommings:
- Support for real tabs has some bugs, mainly involving undo and redo.
- No dynamic/programmable highlighter). For information on these, please
  check the SynEdit webpage:
	http://synedit.sourceforge.net/3rdparty.php 
- No Unicode support. There's a version of SynEdit with Unicode support in
  the CVS repository and it will soon become the official SynEdit package.
  In the meantime you can download it from here: 
  http://mh-nexus.de/unisynedit.htm
- No CodeFolding/CodeWrapping support. Please refer to the Mistyx project:
  http://mystix.sourceforge.net/

To get started check out the different examples. If you have questions, please
subscribe to the SynEdit user list and ask there, if you want to hack SynEdit
you should subscribe to the SynEdit developer list.  General feedback and
suggestions or fixes are very welcome.

There is no documentation yet, help in this area is especially welcome!
