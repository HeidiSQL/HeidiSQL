    elected nodes should be selected again. The nodes will be identified by its caption only.

    lways have a node selected. This behavior is closer to the Windows TreeView and useful in Windows Explorer
    tyle applications. It is also useful for accessible applications which can indicate having the focus by
    isplaying a selection.

  * Some minor changes, improvements and fixes have been incorporated

V5.3.0: (04 Jan 2014)
  * Fix for issue #159 (Cursor missing in edit with non-standard DPI): Ensuring a minimum size of the edit control
  * Fixed issue #403: Declare TVTGetNodeProc as reference to procedure (for D2009+) 
  * Fixed issue #402: TVTEdit.CNCommand discard all notification except EN_UPDATE due to missing inherited
  * Corrected fix for issue #376 (Incorrect selection paint when toGridExtensions is included in the MiscOptions)
  * Fixed issue #401: OnNodeClick event doesn't trigger in some case, coFixed set for a column
  * Modified #316 (concerning r498). The fix for #316 will only be applied in case toMultiSelect is set.
    If toMultiSelect is not set we can start a drag anywhere in the row.
  * ContentToHTML() and ContentToRTF() now return a string of type RawByteString. 
    Because the generated strings are pre-encoded in UTF-8, the previous type AnsiString caused
    problems in Delphi 2009+ e.g. when this string was written using the VCL TStreamWriter class.
    The helper class TBufferedAnsiString therefore uses RywByteString now as type too.
  * Fixed issue #399: EditDelay not working
  * Fixed issue #400: AltGr+A does not behave as expected for foreign keyboard layouts in VTEdit
  * Fixed issue #388: VirtualStringTree with toFixedIndent causes range check error
  * Edit box when editing a node in a tree with toFixedIndent now has the correct indent
  * Fixed issue #392: Now ensuring that MeasureItemHeight() is only called from the main thread.
  * Fixed #383: Clear vsHasChildren for a node without children even if the children count didn't change.
  * Fixed #377: Wrong font (size, etc) in TargetCanvas in MeasureItem for first node
  * Fixed issue #398 (hoAutoResize causes DFM designer to be modified after loading) by calling TControl.Updating()/Updated() in AdjustAutoSize()
  * Preventing possible AV in TBaseVirtualTree.FontChanged()
  * Fixed 32Bit Integer overflows in Win64 build in TBufferedAnsiString.

- Fixed issue #371: property OnGesture is now published.
- Fixed issue #365: No longer changing timer resolution globally
- Fixed issue #347: No expand-pluses seen under Windopws classic theme for a vcl styled application

V5.2.1: (06 Sep 2013)
- Fixed #352 and #354 by modifying the implementation of #237 so that a focused node is ensured only if the
  control is being entered using the TAB key. This is consistent with the behavior of the Windows Explorer.
- Fixed issue #360 (In the calculation of the horizontal scroll bar static text should be considered) by
  calling DoGetNodeExtraWidth() in TBaseVirtualTree.GetMaxRightExtend()
- Used fix proposed in issue #361 to fix issue #357 (AV in advanced demo - PropertiesDemo form in XE3+)

  if not all the initialization was done in the OnInitNode event (reported as #338). vsInitialUserData
  has been renamed to vsOnFreeNodeCallRequired and is now set when GetNodeData is called. This fixes
  the possible memory leak reported in #323 and has better backward compatibility.

  * Fixed issue #553: painting failure with variable NodeHeight
  * Fixed issue #551: Some overlay images were drawn ghosted like the main image, some not. 
  * TBaseVirtualTree.PrepareBitmaps() now fires the OnPrepareButtonImages event also in case VCL styles are used.

  * DoMeasureItem() now ensures that the node was initialized.
  * Issue #493: Editing with DblClick should always open editor immediately.
  * TVirtualTreeColumns.UpdatePositions() now exits immediately if the control is destroying, ths prevents AVs.
  * Added support for CBuilder XE7.

V5.5.1: (13 Oct 2014)
  * Fixed issue #479: The style hooks for the VCL styles are now registered for TVirtualStringTree and TVirtualDrawTree instead of TBaseVirtualTree, which makes it easier to use own style hooks in derived classes.  
  * Partial fix for issue #478: The standard VCL property StyleElemets (public in TControl in RAD Studio XE3 and higher) is now supported and published for TVirtualStringTree and TVirtualDrawTree (XE3 and higher). This means you can define if the font and the backgrounbd color is taken from the VCL style or the control's properties. Leaving out seBorder is not yet working well, more work will be necessary.

  * Fixed possible AV in PaintNodeButton()
  * Now ensuring that both GetHorzScrollBarSliderRect() and
    GetVertScrollBarSliderRect() return a valid value for every code path (Thx to
    Dmitri Dmitrienko). This could cause strange out of resources exceptions with VCL
    styles enabled.
  * Fixed issue #434: Application compiled with Delphi 7 stops responding when you call AddChild 
  * A few minor changes
  
V5.4.0: (22 Apr 2014)
  * Added support for XE6.
  * Added new option toRestoreSelection to TVTSelectionOptions: Set to true if upon refill the previously
    elected nodes should be selected again. The nodes will be identified by its caption only.
  * Added new option toAlwaysSelectNode to TVTSelectionOption enum. If this flag is set, the treeview tries to
    lways have a node selected. This behavior is closer to the Windows TreeView and useful in Windows Explorer
    tyle applications. It is also useful for accessible applications which can indicate having the focus by
    isplaying a selection.
  * Added function TBaseVirtualTree.IsEmpty which returns True if the control has no nodes.  
  * Fixed a wrongly drawn selection after the user scrolled horizontally.
  * Fixed issue #423: Change property TVirtualTreeColumn.Tag to NativeInt.

  * Fixed issue #401: OnNodeClick event doesn't trigger in some case, coFixed set for a column
  * Modified #316 (concerning r498). The fix for #316 will only be applied in case toMultiSelect is set.
    If toMultiSelect is not set we can start a drag anywhere in the row.
  * ContentToHTML() and ContentToRTF() now return a string of type RawByteString. 
    Because the generated strings are pre-encoded in UTF-8, the previous type AnsiString caused
    problems in Delphi 2009+ e.g. when this string was written using the VCL TStreamWriter class.
    The helper class TBufferedAnsiString therefore uses RywByteString now as type too.
  * Fixed issue #399: EditDelay not working
  * Fixed issue #400: AltGr+A does not behave as expected for foreign keyboard layouts in VTEdit

  * Fixed #383: Clear vsHasChildren for a node without children even if the children count didn't change.
  * Fixed #377: Wrong font (size, etc) in TargetCanvas in MeasureItem for first node
  * Fixed issue #398 (hoAutoResize causes DFM designer to be modified after loading) by calling TControl.Updating()/Updated() in AdjustAutoSize()
  * Preventing possible AV in TBaseVirtualTree.FontChanged()
  * Fixed 32Bit Integer overflows in Win64 build in TBufferedAnsiString.
