TBaseVirtualTree is the main and base class for all other Virtual Treeview descendants. This class implements most of the
base features and abilities and can be used to derive new classes, which want to hide most of the details of the tree,
which other descendants like TVirtualStringTree publish. Do not use the base treeview as object. It is not meant to be
instantiated directly, instead via an descendant.

During painting of the main column some coordinates must be adjusted due to the tree lines.
The offset resulting from the tree lines and indentation level is given in Indent.

@@TStringEditLink
Summary
TStringEditLink is the standard node editor of a TVirtualStringTree.

Description
TStringEditLink implements the interface IVTEditLink. This is a simple node editor which wraps a TEdit and is not Unicode
aware. A virtual string tree will use this node editor if the event OnCreateEditor is not handled and a node must be
edited. After the node's text has been edited the event OnNewText will be fired and the application should replace the
\old text with the new and edited text.



The node editor instance will automatically be destroyed via reference counting when it is not needed anymore. Never
destroy it explicitly - except when you know what you are doing.



Remarks
If you want to modify some aspects of how the node editor works, i.e. suppress some characters or initialize it with a
different text but the node's text, you can inherit your own class from TStringEditLink and return an instance of it in
the OnCreateEditor event.

 September 2003
   - Improvement: Edit property of TStringEditLink promoted to public.
   - Improvement: ShortenString better takes right-to-left contexts into account.
   - Improvement: toAlwaysHideSelection introduced. Allows to hide node selections entirely.
   - Improvement: toUseBlendedSelection introduced. Allows to have translucent node selections.
   - Bug fix: Mantis bug entries #140, 144, 125, 122, 129.
   - Improvement: Mantis feature request #113, toSimpleDrawSelection introduced.
   - Improvement: ComputeNodeHeight introduced. Helper method to delegate node height calculation to the tree.
   - Improvement: Alt key might be pressed when clicking in the tree. This allows to start drawing the selection
                  rectangle also on node captions and images (which would otherwise start dragging).
 August 2003
   - Bug fix: ValidateCache was not always called in ToggleNode when InvalidateCache was used.
   - Bug fix: FLastHintRect was sometimes not reset preventing so a new hint to appear.
   - Bug fix: Redundant ChangeCheckState in HandleMouseDown removed.
   - Bug fix: OnHeaderDblClick was triggered even if the colum was set to be unclickable.
   - Bug fix: Wheel panning and scrolling was not possible if toAutoScroll was not set. This option has another meaning
              and should not impact wheel handling.
   - Bug fix: VT control could not be set as ActiveControl at design time.
   - Bug fix: In method ContentToText it could be that the text contained the separator char as regular character, so
              it was necessary to wrap the text with quotation marks then.
   - Bug fix: Bidi mode and aligment was not correctly considered in UpdateEditBounds when grid extensions were enabled.
 July 2003
   - Improvement: Check for nil hint data in TVirtualTreeHintWindow.CalcHintRect just to be on the safe side.
   - Improvedment: TVirtualTreeColumn.ComputeHeaderLayout is now virtual to allow descentants to change the layout.
   - Improvement: toFullVertGridLines, vertical grid lines can be drawn over the full client are height.
   - Improvement: flickering on column resizing is gone.
   - Improvement: System conformal border width calculation for certain tasks.
   - Improvement: Animation parameter for TVTHeader.AutoFitColumns to avoid the size animation (default: True).
   - Improvement: ParentFont property for the header. Default is False to stay compatible with older tree versions.
   - Bug fix: cursor rectangle for spanned columns in normal hint mode was too small.
   - Feature: the implementation is now more than 30.000 lines in size.
   - Bug fix: Access violation fixed, which was sometimes caused by setting VT to edit mode if the old edit link
              was not freed yet (because it was still handling a message).
   - Improvement: Hint animation now does no longer stop quick switches to new hints.
   - Improvement: ParentBackground property published.
   - Bug fix: vsAllChildrenHidden and vsExpanded are now removed from a node's state if there are no child nodes anymore
   - Improvement: column width limit to 10000 is now only applied on non-NT systems (Win9x/Me).
   - Improvement: single letter mode in incremental search is not used if the current node also fits
                  the repeated character.
 June 2003
   - Bug fix: correct theme change handling when switching to classic mode.
   - Improvement: new event OnMeasureItem, new handling for application driven node heights.
     TCustomVirtualStringTree.ComputeNodeHeight implementation to easy node height computation for multi line nodes.
   - Improvement: Header is nil'ed when the tree is destroyed and checked before used in TBaseVirtualTree.Notification
     in order to avoid potential problems accessing an invalid address.
   - Bug fix: The cut and copy pending states in the tree and participating nodes were not removed.
   - Bug fix: csPaintCopy was not considered when painting (used for TWinControl.PaintTo, e.g. in Form.Print).
   - Bug fix: DT_NOPREFIX added for header text output.
 May 2003
   - Bug fix: Thread safe check for current tree reference in the worker thread, as it can be reset before it was used.
   - Bug fix: Color change for non-standard background colors after all columns were hidden.
   - Improvement: new node background erase action (eaNone).

EVirtualTreeError is a normal exception derivation especially for Virtual Treeview. This class does not add much value to
its parent class but is rather there to better tell when an exception particularly from Virtual Treeview was raised.

@@TBufferedString


@@TBaseVirtualTree.Alignment
Summary
Determines the horizontal alignment of text if no columns are defined.

Description
This property is only used if there are no columns defined and applies only to the node captions. Right alignment means
here the right client area border and left aligned means the node buttons/lines etc. (both less the text margin).

@@TBaseVirtualTree.AnimationDuration
Summary
Determines the maximum duration the tree can use to play an animation.

Description
The value is specified in milliseconds and per default there are 200 ms as time frame, which is the recommended duration
for such operations. On older systems (particularly Windows 95 and Windows 98) the animation process might not get enough
CPU time to avoid expensive animations to finish properly. Still the animation loop tries to stay as close as possible to
the given time.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.AutoExpandDelay
Summary
Time delay after which a node gets expanded if it is the current drop target.

Description
This value is specified in milliseconds and determines when to expand a node if it is the current drop target. This value
is only used if voAutoDropExpand in Options is set.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.AutoScrollDelay
Summary
Time which determines when auto scrolling should start.

Description
Once the mouse pointer has been moved near to a border a timer is started using the interval specified by
AutoScrollDelay. When the timer has fired auto scrolling starts provided it is enabled (see also TreeOptions). The value
is specified in milliseconds.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.AutoScrollInterval
Summary

Description
This property determines the speed how the tree is scrolled vertically or horizontally when auto scrolling is in
progress. The value is given in milliseconds.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.Background

Description
Virtual Treeview supports a fixed background image which does not scroll but can be adjusted by BackgroundOffsetX and
BackgroundOffsetY.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.BackgroundOffsetX
Summary
Horizontal offset of the background image.

Description
Determines the horizontal offset of the left border of the background image. This value is relative to the target canvas
where the tree is painted to (usually the tree window).

@@TBaseVirtualTree.BackgroundOffsetY
Summary
Vertical offset of the background image.

Description
This property is used to specify how the interior of the little plus and minus node buttons should be drawn, if
ButtonStyle is bsTriangle.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.ButtonStyle
Summary
Determines the look of node buttons.

Description
Determines the look of node buttons.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.ChangeDelay
Summary
Time which determines when the OnChange event should be triggered after the actual change event.

Description
In order to accumulate many quick changes in the tree you can use this delay value to specify after which wait time the
OnChange event should occur. A value of 0 means to trigger OnChange immediately after the change (usually a selection or
focus change) happend. Any value \> 0 will start a timer which then triggers OnChange.



\Note that there is the synchronous mode (started by BeginSynch) which effectively circumvents the change delay for the
duration of the synchronous mode (stopped by EndSynch) regardless of the ChangeDelay setting.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.CheckImageKind
Summary
Determines which images should be used for checkboxes and radio buttons.

Description
CheckImageKind can be used to switch the image set, which should be used for the tree. Read the description about
TCheckImageKind for a list of all images, which can be used. CheckImageKind can also be set to ckCustom, which allows to
supply a customized set of images to the tree. In order to have that working you must assign an image list
(TCustomImageList) to the CustomCheckImages property.

@@TCheckState
Summary
\Returns the current state of a node's check box, radio button or node button.

Description
The check states include both, transient and fluent (temporary) states. The only temporary state defined so far is the
pressed state.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.CheckState
Summary
Read or set the check state of a node.

Description
The CheckState property can be used to read the current check state of a node or to set a new one. Virtual Treeview
ensures that invalid check states (e.g. csMixedPressed for radio buttons) do not cause an error.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.CheckType
Summary
Read or set the check type of a node.

Description
The CheckType property can be used to read the current check type of a node or to set a new one. Setting a new check type
will reset a the node's check state to csUncheckedNormal.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.ChildCount
Summary
Read or set the number of child nodes of a node.

Description
ChildCount can be used to read the current number of child nodes or to change it. Assigning a lower value than there was
before will automatically delete as many child nodes (starting from the last child) as there are more than what was set.
Increasing the value will add new child nodes. Note: code behind this property is very effective, so it using ChildCount
is highly recommended over manipulating the child count using AddChild, InsertNode and DeleteNode.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.ChildrenInitialized
Summary
Read whether a node's child count has been initialized already.

Description
This read only property is used to determine whether a node's child count has been set. Alternatively, the child count
value is not considered if vsHasChildren is not in the node states.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.ClipboardFormats
Summary
Special class to keep a list of clipboard format descriptions.

Description
This TStringList descendant is used to keep a number of clipboard format descriptions, which are usually used to register
clipboard formats with the system. Using a string list for this task allows to store enabled clipboard formats in the
DFM.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.Colors
Summary

Description
This property holds an instance of the TVTColors class, which is used to customize many of the colors used in a tree.
Placing them all in a specialized class helps organizing the colors in the object inspector and improves general
management.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.CustomCheckImages

Description
This property allows to read the current initial height for new nodes and to set a new value. Note that changing the
property value does <B>not</B> change the height of existing nodes. Only new nodes are affected.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DefaultPasteMode
Summary
Read or set the value, which determines where to add pasted nodes to.

Description
The default paste mode is an attach mode, which is used when pasting data from the clipboard into the tree. Usually, you
will want new nodes to be added as child nodes to the currently focused node (and this is also the default value), but
you can also specify to add nodes only as siblings.



See Also

@@TBaseVirtualTree.HintAnimation
Summary
Read or set the current hint animation type.

Description
With this property you can specify what animation you would like to play when displaying a hint. For some applications it
might not be good to animate hints, hence you can entirely switch them off. Usually however you will leave the system
standard. This way the user can decide whether and which hint animation he or she likes.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragHeight
Summary
Read or set the vertical limit of the internal drag image.

Description
The DragHeight property (as well as the DragWidth property) are only for compatibility reason in the tree. If a platform
does not support the IDropTargetHelper interface (Windows 9x/Me, Windows NT 4.0) then Virtual Treeview uses its own
implementation of a DragImage. Since displaying a translucent drag image is performance hungry you should limit the image
size shown for the drag operation.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragWidth
Summary
Read or set the horizontal limit of the internal drag image.

Description
The DragWidth property (as well as the DragHeight property) are only for compatibility reason in the tree. If a platform
does not support the IDropTargetHelper interface (Windows 9x/Me, Windows NT 4.0) then Virtual Treeview uses its own
implementation of a DragImage. Since displaying a translucent drag image is performance hungry you should limit the image
size shown for the drag operation.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragImage
Summary
Holds the instance of the internal drag image.

Description
For older systems where the IDropTargetHelper interface is not supported Virtual Treeview simulates the translucent drag
image during drag'n drop. The property DragImage makes the internal drag image instance accessible for special handling.
The class itself is always created but is usually not visible when the IDropTargetHelper interface is supported.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragImageKind
Summary
Read or set what should be shown in the drag image.

Description
DragImageKind allows to switch parts of the drag image off and on.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragManager
Summary
Holds the reference to the internal drag manager.

Description
The drag manager is the central point for the drag'n drop support in Virtual Treeview. Usually you do not need to access
it but sometimes it might be necessary so the reference is accessible through this property.

TVTDragManager

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragOperations
Summary
Read or set which drag operations may be allowed in the tree.

Description
Using this property you can determine, which actions may be performed when a drag operation is finished. The default
value includes move, copy and link, where link is rather an esoteric value and only there because it is supported by OLE.
The values used directly determine which image is shown for the drag cursor. The specified drag operations do not tell
which actions will actually be performed but only, which actions are allowed. They still can be modified during drag'n
drop by using a modifier key like the control, shift or alt key or can entirely be ignored by the drop handler.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragSelection
Summary
Keeps a temporary list of nodes during drag'n drop.

Description
This list is a local copy of the current selection array and is only used during a drag operation.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DragType
Summary
Read or set which subsystem should be used for dragging.

Description
Traditionally, Delphi only supports its own drag mechanism, which is not compatible with the rest of the system. This VCL
dragging also does not support to transport random data nor does it support drag operations between applications. Thus
Virtual Treeview also supports the generally used OLE dragging, which in turn is incompatible with VCL dragging.
Depending on your needs you can enable either VCL or OLE dragging as both together cannot be started. However, Virtual
Treeview is able to act as drop target for both kind of data, independant of what is set in DragType.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DrawSelectionMode
Summary
Read or set how multiselection with the mouse is to be visualized.

Description
Virtuall Treeview allows to display two different selection rectangles when doing multiselection with the mouse. One is
the traditiional dotted focus rectangle and the other one is a translucent color rectangle. The latter is the preferred
\one but the former is set as default (for compatibility reasons).

@@TBaseVirtualTree.DropTargetNode
Summary
Contains the current drop target node if the tree is currently the target of a drag'n drop operation.

Description
The drop target node has no meaning except during drag'n drop and only if the tree it belongs to is itself the current
drop target. But even then DropTargetNode might be nil, particularly when the mouse hovers over an area in the tree,
which is not covered by a node.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.EditDelay
Summary
Read or set the maximum time between two single clicks on the same node, which should start node editing.

Description
A node edit operation can be started using the keyboard (F2 key), in code using EditNode or by clicking twice on the same
node (but not doing a double click). EditDelay is the maxmimum time distance between both clicks in which the edit
\operation is started.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.EditLink
Summary
Keeps a reference to the internal edit link during a node edit operation.

Description
During an edit operation a link is established between the tree and the editor for the current node. By default a simple
TEdit control is used as editor but due to the great customization possibilities there can be any node editor you may
want. In order to communicate with this potentially unknown node editor the edit link is used. The EditLink property
holds this link during the edit operation, so you can manipulate the interface.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.FullyVisible
Summary
Read or set whether a node is fully visible or not.

Description
Beside the fact that a node can be out of the client area there are two possibilities for it to be hidden. One is the
vsVisible state in TVirtualNodeState, which hides the node regardles of the current state of another node, if not
specified. The other one is that one or more parent nodes might be collapsed, hiding so their entire child nodes
structure. The visibility flag itself can be checked using the IsVisible property, while the expansion state of parents
nodes can be examined via the VisiblePath property. If both are true then the node is said to be fully visible.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.HasChildren
Summary
Read or set whether a node has got children.

Description
A node can be set to have children by assigning true to this property. Internally this will add the vsHasChildren state
to the node but not add any child nodes. This state in turn will cause the node to be drawn with a plus sign in front of
its caption, denoting so it can be expanded and will show child nodes. As long as the child nodes are not touch in any
way (e.g. by expanding the parent node or by navigatin or searching/sorting the tree) there will be no actual child
nodes. They simply do not exist yet. However they will be created as soon as an access is done.



Setting the HasChildren property to false will delete any existing child node.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.OnDragDrop
Summary
Drag'n drop support event.

Description
Triggered when either a VCL or a OLE drop action occured. Accepting drag and drop actions is not trivial. In order to
maintain a minimum compatibility with the VCL drag'n drop system Virtual Tree accepts not only OLE drop actions but also
those issued by the Delphi VCL (which is totally different to the OLE way, unfortunately), provided toAcceptOLEDrop is
set in TreeOptions.MiscOptions. The code snippet below is taken from a sample project provided with Virtual Tree. It
shows a general way to deal with dropped data. The following check list can be used as orientation and additional comment
to the code:



      1. Determine what kind of drop data is passed. If <B>DataObject</B> is nil or <B>Formats</B> is empty then the drag
         source is a VCL control. The event is not triggered for OLE drag'n drop if there is no OLE format is available (which
         should never occur).
      2. If the event is triggered by a VCL control then use <B>Source</B> to access either the control or the drag
         \object, depending on the circumstances of the action.
      3. For OLE drag'n drop iterate through the <B>Formats</B> list to find a format you can handle.
      4. If you find CF_VIRTUALTREE then the source of the drag operation is a Virtual Treeview. Since this is the native
         tree format you can pass it to the <B>Sender</B>'s ProcessDrop method which will take care to retrieve the data and act
         depending on <B>Effect</B> and <B>Mode</B>. No further action by the application is usually required in this case.
      5. If you do not find CF_VIRTUALTREE then the operation has been initiated by another application, e.g. the
         Explorer (then you will find CF_HDROP or CF_SHELLIDLIST in formats) or Notepad (then you will get CF_TEXT and perhaps
         CF_UNICODETEXT) etc., depending on the data which is actually dropped.
      6. Use the provided <B>DataObject</B> to get the drop data via IDataObject.GetData and act depending on the format
         you get.
      7. Finally set <B>Effect</B> to either DROPEFFECT_COPY, DROPEFFECT_MOVE or DROPEFFECT_NONE to indicate which
         \operation needs to be finished in <B>Sender</B> when the event returns. If you return DROPEFFECT_MOVE then all marked
         nodes in the source tree will be deleted, otherwise they stay where they are.

determined, e.g. while doing draw selection with the mouse or painting the tree. <B>Kind</B> determines which image is
needed and <B>Column</B> determines for which column of the node the image is needed. This value can be -1 to indicate
there is no column used. The parameter <B>Ghosted</B> can be set to true to blend the image 50% against the tree
background and can be used for instance in explorer trees to mark hidden file system objects. Additionally nodes are also
drawn with a ghosted icon if the are part of a cut set during a pending cut-to-clipboard operation. In this case changing

@@TBaseVirtualTree.OnGetNodeDataSize
Summary
Data management event.

Description
Triggered when access to a node's data happens the first time but the actual data size is not yet set. Usually you would
specify the size of the data you want to have added to each node by NodeDataSize, e.g. SizeOf(TMyRecord) is quite usual
there (where TMyRecord is the structure you want to have stored in the node). Sometimes, however it is not possible to
determine the node size in advance, so you can leave NodeDataSize being -1 (the default value) and the OnGetNodeDataSize
event is triggered as soon as the first regular node is created (the hidden root node does not have user data but
\internal data which is determined by other means).

@@TBaseVirtualTree.OnSaveNode
Summary
Streaming support event.

Description
This event is triggered whenever a certain node must be serialized into a stream, e.g. for saving to file or for copying
to another tree/node during a clipboard or drag'n drop operation. Make sure you only store non-transient data into the
stream. Pointers (including long/wide string references) are transient and the application cannot assume to find the data
a pointer references on saving at the same place when the node is loaded (see also OnLoadNode). This is even more
essential for nodes which are moved or copied between different trees in different processes (applications). Storing
strings however is easily done by writing the strings as a whole into the stream.

Note
For exchanging data between different trees and for general stability improvement I strongly recommend that you insert a
kind of identifier as first stream entry when saving a node. This identifier can then be used to determine what data will
follow when loading the node later and does normally not required to be stored in the node data.

Summary
Reference to the internal root node which is the anchor of the entire tree node hierarchy.

Description
For anchoring the tree hierarchy an internal tree node is maintained which is mostly just like any other tree node but
has sometimes differently handled. The root node is always expanded and initialized. Its parent member points to the
treeview to which the node belongs to and its PreviousSibling and NextSibling members point to the root node itself to
make it possible to actually recognize this node.

Note
You should not use the root node to iterate through the tree. It is only publicly accessible because it is the parent of
all top level nodes and can be used to test a node whether it is a top level node or not.

Summary
Read or set the current blend factor for the multi selection rectangle and the node selection rectangle.

Description
For a visually appealing tree some operations use alpha blending. One of these operations is multi selection using the

SelectionBlendFactor to determine how much of the underlying tree image and how much of the rectangles should be seen.
The factor can be in the range of [0..255] where 0 means the rectangle is fully transparent and 255 it is fully opaque.



If you don't like to use blended node selection rectangles then switch them off by removing toUseBlendedSelection from
TVTPaintOptions. For selecting a certain multi selection rectangle style use DrawSelectionMode.

Note
This property is quite counter productive as it causes the entire tree to be validated when queried. This means that each

when you release the wheel button before you moved the mouse. In this mode you can move the mouse and do the tree
scrolling without holding the wheel all the time. To stop this mode simple turn the wheel, or click any mouse button.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.AllocateInternalDataArea@Cardinal
Summary
Registration method to allocate tree internal data per node.

Description
This method is used for descentants to specify their need for internal data. Each node contains some extra reserved bytes
between the node's normal members and the user data area. This internal area can be used to cache additional information,
e.g. the string tree keeps here the width of the node's caption in the main column for quick hit tests when doing draw
selection with the mouse.



A tree implementation must call this method only once and before any node is created (except the hidden root node which
is handled accordingly). The result value is the offset from the start of the node to the internal data area of the node
for this tree class. I recommend to implement an access method called InternalData (as shown in TCustomVirtualStringTree)
which does the pointer mathematic.

Similar to BeginUpdate does BeginSynch provide a mechanism to bring certain events into a common line. That means,
whenever you need to make sure change events are called before a modification in the tree is finished (e.g. when changing
the focus or selection) then use the synchronous mode started with BeginSynch (and stopped with EndSynch).

@@TBaseVirtualTree.CopyToClipBoard
Summary
Copies all currently selected nodes to the clipboard.

Description
CopyToClipboard causes the tree to copy the currently selected nodes to the clipboard. Actually, Virtual Treeview
maintains socalled delayed rendering. This means the participating nodes are marked as being in the current clipboard set
(see vsCutOrCopy in TVirtualNodeStates) and only an IDataObject interface is placed onto the clipboard but no data yet.
This avoids not only possibly huge memory requirements but it also avoids rendering data in a format which is not
necessary. The application which pastes the clipboard content later will get the IDataObject interface and requests the
format it can handle. The actual data is then rendered when the target application calls IDataObject.GetData, which
results in a call to RenderOLEData.

Determines the type of animation to be used.

Description
Windows 98 and Windows 2000 introduced two ways of animating hints when they appear: a sliding window and a fading
window. Virtual Treeview implements both animation types and also supports system dependent animations. This allows to
use the animation type enabled in the particular system on which the tree currently runs. Additonally, there is a check
for MMX to do a fallback if fade animation is specified but no MMX available. In this case sliding is used. Starting with

Description
GetNodeData returns the address of the user data area for <B>Node</B>. It is strongly recommended to use this method

hidden root node). Top level nodes have the level 0, their direct child nodes have level 1 etc.

@@TBaseVirtualTree.GetOptionsClass
Summary
Customization helper to determine which options class the tree should use.

Description
GetOptionsClass is a special purpose method to return a certain class which is used by the tree for its options.
TVirtualBaseTree always returns TCustomVirtualTreeOptions but descendants can override this method to return own classes.



For ease of use it makes much sense to always use the same name for the tree's options (which is TreeOptions). By using a
customized options class, however, the wrong type is returned by this property. Hence it is meaningful to override
TreeOptions and return the derived options class. To make this work the tree descendant must additionally provide new
access methods for this property. An example can be seen in TVirtualStringTree:

the properties HintPause and HintShortPause of the global Application object.

@@TCustomVirtualStringTree.OnGetText
Summary
Virtual string tree event to query for a node's normal or static text.

Description
This is one of the fundamental string tree events which must always be handled. The string tree will fire this event
every time when it needs to know about the text of a specific node and column. This is mainly the case when the node
appears in the visible area of the tree view (in other words it is not scrolled out of view) but also on some other
\occasions, including streaming, drag and drop and calculating the width of the node.



The node text is distinguished between two text types:



    * Normal text: If TextType is ttNormal return the main node caption for the specified column.
    * Static text: All text that you return when TextType is ttStatic will be displayed right beside the normal text (or
      left to it if the column's BidiMode is not bdLeftToRight, i.e. the column has right-to-left layout). Static text is used
      \only for informational purposes; it cannot be selected or dragged and if the column is not wide enough to show all text
      it will not be shortened with an ellipsis (...) as normal text. The string tree will only query for static text if the
      StringOptions (see TreeOptions) include toShowStaticText. This is off by default.



When this event is fired the text parameter will always be initialized with the value of property DefaultText. To handle
the event get your node data and then extract the string for the appropriate column and TextType.

OnPaintText

Note
Be sure that your event handler only contains absolutely necessary code. This event will be fired very often - easily a
few hundred times for medium sized trees with some columns defined when the tree is repainted completely.
For example it is far too slow to use Locate() on some Dataset, a database query result or table, and then get the text
from some TField. This may only work with in-memory tables or a client dataset. When you initialize your node data do
some caching and use these cached values to display the data.

@@TCustomVirtualStringTree.OnNewText
Summary
Virtual string tree event to pass edited text.

Description
A string tree will fire this event after a node has been edited successfully (not canceled with Escape). The event
handler must store the new text in the node data.



This event will only be used for the default node caption editor. Other custom node editors may or may not use this event
to pass their edited data to the application. Editing for the whole tree is only possible if the MiscOptions (see
TreeOptions) include toEditable. If only certain columns or nodes should be editable write an event handler for
OnEditing.

@@TCustomVirtualStringTree.OnPaintText
Summary
Event to change text formatting for particular nodes.

Description
Write an event handler for this event to render nodes with different fonts, font sizes, styles or colors. According to
the parameters each column of each node and even normal and static text can be painted in different ways.

Note
The string tree view manages an internal width for each node's main column. This is done because computing this width is
quite costly and the width is needed on several occasions. If you change the font which is used to paint a node's text,
for example to bold face style, its width changes but the tree view does not know this - it still relies on its cached
node width. This may result in cut off selection rectangles among others.
Hence if the width of a node changes after its initialization because it is now formatted differently than before force a
recalculation of the node width by calling InvalidateNode (when the conditions for the changed formatting are met - not
in the event handler for OnPaintText).

Summary
String tree event for custom handling of string abbreviations.

Description
If the text of a node does not fit into its cell (in grid mode) or is too wide for the width of the tree view it is being
abbreviated with an ellipsis (...). By default the ellipsis is added to the end of the node text.

Occasionally you may want to shorten the node text at a different position, for example if the node text is a path string
and not the last folder or filename should be cut off but rather some mid level folders if possible.

expand to the right cell neighbors if they are empty. To make this work it is necessary to know if a cell is considered
as being empty, whatever this means to an application. The string tree descendant simply checks the text for the given
cell and calls back its ancestor if there is no text to further refine if the cell must stay as if it contained
something. The ancestor (TBaseVirtualTree) now triggers OnGetCellIsEmpty to let the application decide.

Summary
General purpose procedure to blend one bitmap to another.

Description
This is an optimized alpha blend procedure using MMX instructions to perform as quick as possible. For this procedure to
work properly it is important that both source and target bitmap use the 32 bit color format (pf32Bit for TBitmap). <B>R</B>
describes the source rectangle to work on, while <B>Target</B> is the place (upper left corner) in the target bitmap
where to blend to. Note that source width + X offset must be less or equal to the target width. Similar for the height.



If <B>Mode</B> is bmConstantAlpha then the blend operation uses the given ConstantAlpha value for all pixels.

If <B>Mode</B> is bmPerPixelAlpha then each pixel is blended using its individual alpha value (the alpha value of the
source).

If <B>Mode</B> is bmMasterAlpha then each pixel is blended using its individual alpha value multiplied by ConstantAlpha.

If <B>Mode</B> is bmConstantAlphaAndColor then each destination pixel is blended using ConstantAlpha but also a constant
color which will be obtained from Bias. In this case no offset value is added, otherwise Bias is used as offset.



Blending of a color into target only (bmConstantAlphaAndColor) ignores <B>Source</B> (the DC) and <B>Target</B> (the
position).

@@TreeFromNode@PVirtualNode
Summary
General purpose routine to get the tree to which a node belongs.

Description
For obvious reasons it makes no sense to store the reference to a tree in each node record, but sometimes there might
arise the need to know to which tree a node belongs. This is not often the case but is necessary e.g. for optimized moves
in drag'n drop or cut'n paste operations.



Each node contains a reference to its parent to allow fast traversal. The hidden root node, however, does not need this
reference because it does not have a node parent. Instead it contains the reference of the tree to which it belongs. To
determine which node is the root node (when you don't know its tree) a special case of sibling reference is used. Since
the root node does neither have a previous nor a next sibling the corresponding pointers are set to the root node, making
the root so pointing to itself. This case will never happen in "normal" nodes, so it is a reliable way to detect the root
node.

formats. The following formats are registered by Virtual Treeview:

    * CVS: comma separated values, a tabular data format.
    * HTML: text data with text formatting and structured like a big table. Unicode is supported as well (UTF-8).
    * RTF: rich text format, similar to HTML, but more complex and also a bit older.
    * RTFNOOBJS: like RTF but without embedded objects (not used by Virtual Treeview).

@@IVTEditLink
Summary
Interface which is used for communication between the treeview and a node editor.

Description
Due to the virtual nature of the tree it is necessary to supply a kind of plug in interface for application defined node
editors. TCustomVirtualStringTree is the first class which implements a node editor. This is just a generic editor to
edit a node's caption just like TTreeview does it. Because of the lack of support under Win9x system this editor only can
edit ANSI text. You have to create an own editor to make also Unicode string editing available for node captions.



All node editors must implement this interface to allow the treeview to communicate with the node editor. Node editors
are small components or forms. If a node shall be edited (for instance when the user presses F2) the treeview will fire
the event OnCreateEditor. The application must determine which node editor must be used for the data in the given node
and column. Then it creates and returns an instance of the appropriate node editor.

The life cycle of the node editor object is handled via reference counting. This means that the application must not
destroy the node editor explicitly - this will happen automatically when the node editor is not used anymore.

@@IVTEditLink.BeginEdit
Summary
This function will be called by the virtual tree when the editing starts.

Description
Write code to actually display the node editor here. This might be something like Visible := True or Show. The return
value should be true if editing can start or false otherwise. Before this function is called PrepareEdit and SetBounds
are executed.

@@IVTEditLink.CancelEdit
Summary
This function will be called by the virtual tree when the current editing is about to be cancelled.

Description
Hide the node editor here. This might be something like Visible := False or Hide. The return value should be True if the
editing can be cancelled. Return false if the node editor is in an internal state which does not allow to cancel the
editing right now.



Do not destroy the node editor instance because this will be done implicitly via reference counting.

Note
If the edited tree is changed during this function, i.e. focus change, node deletion and so on, CancelEdit might be
called again by the tree which can lead to access violations. It is therefore advisable to block reentrancy with a
boolean variable. Example:
<CODE>
<B>function</B> TStringEditLink.CancelEdit: Boolean;
<B>begin</B>
  \Result := <B>not</B> FStopping;
  <B>if</B> Result <B>then</B>
  <B>begin</B>
    FStopping := True;
    FEdit.Hide;
    FTree.CancelEditNode;
  <B>end</B>;
<B>end</B>;

</CODE>

@@IVTEditLink.EndEdit
Summary
This function will be called by the virtual tree when the current editing is being finished.

Description
Hide the node editor here. This might be something like Visible := False or Hide. The return value should be true if the
editing can be finished. Return false if the node editor is in an internal state which does not allow to finish the
editing right now - possibly because there is no valid value available at the moment. If the editing can be finished
transmit the edited value to the tree or to the data structure which is displayed in the tree.



Do not destroy the node editor instance because this will be done implicitly via reference counting.

Note
If the edited tree is changed during this function, i.e. focus change, node deletion and so on, EndEdit might be called
again by the tree which can lead to access violations. It is therefore advisable to block reentrancy with a boolean
variable. Example:

<CODE>
<B>function</B> TStringEditLink.EndEdit: Boolean;
<B>begin</B>
  \Result := <B>not</B> FStopping;
  <B>if</B> Result <B>then</B>

    FStopping := True;

@@IVTEditLink.GetBounds
Summary
The virtual tree can use this function to get the current bounding rect of the node editor.

Description
The bounding rect of the node editor may change during the editing to reflect the changed edit contents. The tree uses
this function to query the current bounding rect of the editor. VCL components derived from TControl have a BoundsRect
property which can be used as a return value here.

@@IVTEditLink.PrepareEdit@TBaseVirtualTree@PVirtualNode@TColumnIndex
Summary
This function is called by a virtual tree to initialize the node editor.

Description
Use PrepareEdit to initialize the node editor. This includes getting the node content in the specified column which will
be needed later when the editor is shown. BeginEdit may be called anytime after this function returns. If the
initialization fails simply return false (exceptions should be trapped).

@@IVTEditLink.ProcessMessage@TMessage
Summary
This function is used to forward messages being directed to the virtual tree.

Description
Some node editors might need to trap some messages which are directed to the treeview window. This function remedies the
need to subclass the virtual tree via its WindowProc property. If these messages are not needed leave the function body
empty.

@@IVTEditLink.SetBounds@TRect
Summary
The virtual tree calls this function to initialize the bounding rectangle of the node editor.

Description
This function is usually called after PrepareEdit and before BeginEdit in order to place the node editor exactly over the
node which is about to be edited. Use the R parameter to set the bounding rect of the editor. If the treeview is in grid
mode R will be equal to the cell rectangle of the to be edited cell. Otherwise R is the bounding rectangle of the actual
node text.

Note
SetBounds is also a method of TControl. Hence if your node editor is implemented by a descendant of TControl you must use
a method resolution clause to avoid a name clash. The clause can look similar to this:
<CODE>
<B>procedure</B> EditLinkSetBounds(R: TRect); <B>stdcall</B>;
<B>procedure</B> IVTEditLink.SetBounds = EditLinkSetBounds;
</CODE>
