    as Comma-Separated-Values (handle RawUTF8 text, double or integer arrays)
  - new definition of PtrInt/PtrUInt, to match NativeInt/NativeUInt types,
    available since Delphi 2007 - some code rewrite in order to avoid any
    implicit conversion from/to integer/cardinal

  Version 1.9.2
  - new StringReplaceChars function

  Version 1.10
  - code modifications to compile with Delphi 6 compiler (Delphi 5 failed due
    to some obscure compiler bugs in SynCrypto.pas)

  Version 1.11
  - fix some obscure Delphi 2009 bug according to NativeUInt :(
  - source code modified to be 7 bit Ansi (so will work with all encodings)
  - a lot of code refactoring for our internal fork of ZeosLib
    (e.g. ISO 8601 date time extracted from SQLite3Commons, QuotedStr..)

    read/write access to huge files, with new 32/64-bit variable-length integer
    encoding and optimized storage of IDs or Offsets (used in TSynBigTable)
  - new function UnQuoteSQLString()

  - TSynMemoryStream now replaces TRawUTF8Stream class, with constructors using
    either an AnsiString, either a memory buffer
  - new TSynTable, TSynTableFieldProperties and TSynTableStatement classes
    to handle a generic database table storing field values using our SBF
    compact binary format (more compact than BSON, similar to Protocol Buffers)

  - new low-level RTTI functions for handling record types: RecordEquals,
    RecordSave, RecordSaveLength, RecordLoad, RecordClear and RecordCopy
  - new TDynArray object, which is a wrapper around any dynamic array: you can
    now access to the dynamic array using TList-like properties and methods,
    e.g. Count, Add, Insert, Delete, Clear, IndexOf, Find, Sort and some
    new methods like LoadFromStream, SaveToStream, LoadFrom and SaveTo which
    allow fast binary serialization of any dynamic array, even containing
    strings or records; a CreateOrderedIndex method is also available to
    create individual index according to the dynamic array content; and any
    dynamic array can be serialized as UTF-8 JSON via TTextWriter.AddDynArrayJSON
    and TDynArray.LoadFromJSON methods
  - introducing direct content filtering and validation using
    TSynFilterOrValidate dedicated classes, for both TSQLRecord and SynBigTable
  - filtering is handled via some TSynFilter classes - TSynFilterUpperCase,
    TSynFilterUpperCaseU, TSynFilterLowerCase, TSynFilterLowerCaseU and
    TSynFilterTrim e.g.
  - validation is handled via some TSynValidate classes - TSynValidateRest,
    TSynValidateIPAddress, TSynValidateEmail, TSynValidatePattern,
    TSynValidatePatternI, TSynValidateText, TSynValidatePassWord e.g.
  - dedicated TSynTableFieldProperties.Validate method for validation (e.g. a
    TSynValidateTableUniqueField instance is created if tfoUnique is in Options)

  - new BinToBase64, Base64ToBin and IsBase64 *fast* conversion functions
    (with optimized assembler version, using CPU pipelining and lookup table)
  - introducing the GarbageCollector TObjectList for handling a global garbage
    collector for instances which must live during the whole executable process
    (used e.g. to avoid a memory leak for "class var" or such variables)
  - new TSynLog class to handle enhanced logging to any application, with
    exception handling (+stack trace) and customer-side performance profiling
  - new TSynMapFile class to retrieve debugging information from .map file (and
    able to save and read smaller .mab files) - used by TSynLog if available
  - new TSynTestsLogged test suit class, with automated test case logging
  - Windows version detection enhanced, now retrieving TWindowsVersion enumerate
  - great performance improvement in TSynTableFieldProperties for update process
  - added TMemoryMap and TSynMemoryStreamMapped to handle memory-mapped files
  - added TMemoryMapText class to fast handle big UTF-8 text files (like logs)
  - now TTextWriter can have a custom internal buffer size (default 4096 bytes)
  - now TFileBufferWriter and TFileVersion are regular classes, not an
    object/record any more (this was incoherent since Delphi 2010)
  - new TFileBufferReader.OpenFrom(Stream) and ReadRawUTF8 methods
  - now TSynCache will use faster TDynArrayHashed for its content hashing

  - new SynLZ related compression functions: FileSynLZ/FileUnSynLZ and
    StreamSynLZ/StreamUnSynLZ
  - source can now be parsed per all Delphi IDE pre-parser (dual declaration as
    record or object because of Delphi 2010 and up was not understood)

    with some speed enhancements and new associated tests
  - fixed issue in produced JSON stream using '=' instead of ':'
  - new DoubleToStr(), StrCurr64(), UnicodeBufferToString(),
    RawUnicodeToString(), FillChar(), UpperCopy255W(), GetCaptionFromEnum(),
    SortDynArrayUnicodeString(), SortDynArrayUnicodeStringI() functions

  Version 1.15
  - unit now tested with Delphi XE2 (32 Bit)
  - TSynLog now writes the elapsed time (in us) for Enter/Leave events, and
    will flush the log content to disk on any exception (for safety)
  - new sllTrace and sllWarning levels for TSynLog class
  - new TSynLog.DefaultExtension property (set to '.log' by default)
  - new TSynLogFile.LogProc[] property for customer-side method profiling,
    with LogProcSort method available for sorting the resulting array, and
    LogProcMerged property to merge the location name timing
  - new TSynMapFile.FindLocation method for high-level .map symbol access

  - new TMemoryMapText.LineContains method for fast case-insensitive search
  - TSynTests now writes the elapsed time in each test in the final report
  - faster late binding process for our variants custom types (i.e.
    TSynTableVariantType and TSQLDBRowVariantType): you can call
    SynRegisterCustomVariantType() function to register any other custom
    variant type, and enhance GetProperty/SetProperty process speed
  - includes our optimized RecordCopy procedure in replacement to the slower
    default System.@CopyRecord internal RTL function
  - our optimized Move() and FillChar() will replac the default System RTL
    function, for Delphi versions prior to 2007 (which didn't contain those)

  - new TRawByteStringStream class (a TStream using a RawByteString as internal
    storage), especially useful since Delphi 2009
  - new TSynNameValue object, to efficiently handle Name/Value RawUTF8 pairs
    (using hashing for Name search)
  - TTextWriter.CreateOwnedStream now create an internal TRawByteStringStream
    instance for faster process and direct retrieval in the Text method
  - JSONEncode*() global functions will use an internal TRawByteStringStream
    instead of a supplied TMemoryStream

    (inserting '?' as inlined :(...): parameters, with proper string quote) -
    with associated regression tests

  Version 1.16
  - introducing new TSynAnsiConvert and TSynAnsiFixedWidth classes, able to
    process Unicode to/from Ansi conversion in all possible code pages, with
    generic access methods and optimized handling of fixed width encodings
  - added dedicated Exception classes (ESynException, ETableDataException)
  - TSynLog allows read sharing of the .log created file
  - TSynLog now stores the executable build time, and library name (if any) -
    this is a small change of the .log format as expected by the LogViewer tool
    (so you should upgrade your LogViewer.exe to its latest version)
  - TSynLog and TSynMapFile now handle libraries (.dll/.ocx/.bpl) .map/.mab
    debugging information (only .exe was previously handled)
  - TSynCache now handles an optional Tag: PtrInt value parameter (used e.g.
    to store the row counts of a SQL result cache in mORMot)
  - TSynCache now uses the generic TSynNameValue object from its internal
    hashed list implementation (avoid duplicated code)
  - TMemoryMapText class (and therefore TSynLogFile) is now able to map/open
    an existing file: it will allow e.g. the SynLogViewer to browse a .log file
    which is actually still opened and working by the main application
  - faster RawUnicodeToUtf8() and UTF8ToWideChar() functions, thanks to very
    clever speed-up proposals by Sha (also included in TSynAnsi* classes)
  - JSONDecode() overloaded functions now accept parameter names without case
    sensibility (and a new HandleValuesAsObjectOrArray parameter)
  - new JSONDecode() overloaded function, to properly handle unserialization
    of a JSON object within a buffer (used e.g. for TDynArrayJSONCustomReader)
  - JSON functions now handle '0' as number according to http://json.org specs
  - new TTextWriter.AddJSONEscape() overloaded function, to be used to directly
    serialize some name/value pairs as a JSON object content (used e.g. for
    TDynArrayJSONCustomWriter callbacks)
  - new FileSize(), RoundTo2Digits() and RawByteStringArrayConcat() functions
  - new TPrecisionTimer Pause and Resume methods
  - new TSynTestCase.CheckFailed method (most of the time, Check is sufficient)
  - new TSynLogFamily.IncludeComputerNameInFileName property
  - new TTextWriter.WrRecord method for direct adding of a Base-64 record content
  - new TTextWriter.AddNoJSONEscapeString method
  - new TRawUTF8ListHashed class, with extend TRawUTF8List by using an internal
    hash table to optimized IndexOf() method call (including case sensitivity)
  - new ToVarInt64() and FromVarInt64() functions to encode and decode
    variable-length signed Int64 values (with the corresponding new tftVarInt64
    kind of variable-length column in TSynTableFieldType enumeration)
  - new GotoNextJSONObjectOrArray() and RawUTF8ArrayToQuotedCSV() functions
  - new ReadStringFromStream() and WriteStringToStream() functions
  - fixed some compilation warnings with Delphi XE and XE2
  - fixed issue in TDynArrayHashed if you do not use the external Count
  - fixed potential GPF in TDynArrayHashed.ReHash after TDynArray.Clear call
  - fixed issue in TSynTableFieldProperties.SaveTo about saving wrong indexes
  - fixed issue TSynTableStatement when only one column was retrieved
  - fixed rounding issue in ExtendedToString() and all corresponding wrappers
    like DoubleToStr*, Add(Double...)
  - fixed issue in Hash32() implementation (potential GPF when reading ahead
    by DWORD - get rid of unnecessary asm optimization)
  - fixed issues in function IsJSONString() which returned TRUE for '-' or '+',
    or false positives in some border-line cases (due to wrong uppercase guess):
    now this function is split into IsString() and IsStringJSON() functions
    to explicitely handle null/false/true constant recognition
  - fixed potential false positives of null/false/true in function GetJSONField
  - get rid of wrong "Decimal" parameter in float to text conversion
  - TFileBufferWriter.Create now accepts up to 4 MB internal buffer size
  - increased TDynArrayHashed number of void entries (for speed)
  - modified TDynArray.SaveToStream/LoadFromStream to read or save the data
    from the current stream position
  - fixed GPF in TDynArray.SaveTo in case of invalid internal record layout
  - modified StreamUnSynLZ() so that Source stream will point after all read data
  - TDynArray.SaveToStream() method can now save to any TStream class
  - added TTextWriter.RegisterCustomJSONSerializer() method to allow JSON
    serialization of any dynamic array content (used by TDynArray.LoadFromJSON
    and TTextWriter.AddDynArrayJSON) and record content (used by RecordLoadJSON
    and TTextWriter.AddRecordJSON)
  - added USEPACKAGES conditional to help compiling the unit within packages
  - added optional DOPATCHTRTL to patch the RTL (RecordCopy low-level function)
    only if needed (not patched by default, for compatibility reasons) - you
    may want to use our Enhanced RTL patchs instead for a whole better response
  - new function BinToBase64URI()
  - circumvent some bugs of Delphi XE2 background compiler (main compiler is OK)
  - add premilinary Windows 8 operating system detection (as wEight/wEightServer)

  Version 1.17
  - check of QueryPerformanceFrequency failure, and rollback to low-resolution timer
  - handle properly old .synlz layout (reading compatibility was broken)
  - added TObjectListHashed class, which behaves like TList/TObjectList, but
    will use hashing for (much) faster IndexOf() method, and associated
    TObjectListPropertyHashed class, which allows hashing of a sub-property
    of an object (including some changes made to TDynArray/TDynArrayHashed)
  - new TTextWriter.AddDateTime() overloaded method able to quote the output
  - new TTextWriter.AddFloatStr() method handling partial floating-point text
  - both TTextWriter.AddDateTime() overloaded methods will store '' when value
    is 0, or a pure ISO-8601 date or time if the value is defined as such,
    just as expected by http://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html - it will also
    reduce average generated JSON/text content size
  - fixed issue about BLOB unproperly serialized into JSON (e.g. now uses null)
  - fixed ticket [e5ad3684b2] about some .map files parsing in TSynMapFile
  - TSynLog stack tracing uses low-level RtlCaptureStackBackTrace() API on CPU64  
  - changed the non expanded JSON format to use lowercase first column names:
    {"fieldCount":1,"values":["col1"... instead of {"FieldCount":1,"Values":[..
  - new SetInt64() procedure for direct assignment of the result
  - TSynTableStatement class now accepts '_' in table and column identifiers
  - fixed implementation issue in function FindNextUTF8WordBegin()
  - fixed false negative issue in TSynSoundEx.UTF8 and TSynSoundEx.Ansi
  - fixed wrong UTF-8 encoding of U+FFF0 used for JSON_BASE64_MAGIC 
  - added an optional parameter to StrToCurr64() function, able to return
    a true Int64 value if no decimal is supplied within the input text buffer

  - new UTF8UpperCopy() and UTF8UpperCopy255() optimized functions
  - new GotoNextNotSpace() and GotoEndOfQuotedString() functions
  - new TMemoryMap.Map() method expecting a file name as parameter
  - new TRawUTF8List.LoadFromFile() method
  - new DateToSQL(), DateTimeToSQL() and Iso8601ToSQL() functions, returning
    a string with a JSON_SQLDATE_MAGIC prefix and proper UTF-8/ISO-8601 encoding
    to be inlined as ? bound parameter in any SQL query (allow binding of
    date/time parameters as request by some external database engine
    which does not accept ISO-8601 text in this case)
  - added TDynArray.Equals() method to compare two arrays efficiently
  - added TDynArray and TDynArrayHashed InitSpecific() method able to specify
    how (hashing and) comparison should be processed for a given record
    (includes also some TDynArray/TDynArrayHashed refactoring and optimization)
  - new TObjectHash abstract class to use hashing to find an object
  - TTextWriter.AddJSONEscape() method speed up
  - moved logging threadvars and associated structures into hidden internal
    declaration, for better work with packages (avoid W1032 warning)

  - now JSON parser will allow whitespace inserted between any pair of tokens,
    even after true/false/null, as expected by the specification
  - fixed potential Integer Overflow error in Iso8601ToDateTimePUTF8Char*()
  - added PatchCode() and RedirectCodeRestore() procedures, and some code
    refactoring about process in-memory code patching
  - internal FillChar() will now use faster SSE2 instructions on supported CPUs
