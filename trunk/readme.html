	<h2 id="requirements">Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>
		We will assume that you have some general developer experience.<br />
		If you do find anything which you don't understand in this document, feel free to ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the software department, you'll need the following for building HeidiSQL:
		<ul><li>Borland Developer Studio 2006</li></ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		All third party components and dependencies used by HeidiSQL is included in the Subversion
		repository and the source package.
	</p>

	<h2 id="compiler">What is Borland Developer Studio?</h2>
	<p>
		Delphi is a graphical development environment.  It uses a language which is as powerful as C++,
		but has a much clearer and better syntax, named Pascal.  Pascal is a modern language, with major
		benefits compared to other languages, among them is great support for Structured Exception Handling,
		the various types of strings in existence, componentized development, and other things.  It also has
		it's drawbacks, mostly minor things on the technical front like for example the newbie-friendly but
		overly verbose "begin -> end" scope declarators and lack of various syntactic sugar such as "+=" and "?:".
	</p>

	<p>
		On the corporate side of things are more grave issues, such as lack of communication with developers
		and Borland seemingly wanting to get rid of the compiler business as a whole.  Luckily, we don't have
		to care too much about that, as the product pretty much works just fine as it is :-).
	</p>

	<p>
		Update: The entire suite of compiler and code IDE products from Borland has been sold to CodeGear.
	</p>

	<p>
		Borland Developer Studio (BDS) is the name of the successor of the Delphi environment.
		BDS 2005 is also known as Delphi 9, and BDS 2006 is also known as Delphi 10.  We'll be using the name
		"Delphi", both when we refer to older versions and to newer ones (BDS).
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="#contents">To table of contents</a>
	</p>

	<hr />


	<h2 id="compilerversion">Which version of Delphi do I need (and where can I get it)?</h2>
	<p>
		HeidiSQL actually builds with at least Delphi 6 and upwards, but there's only a complete set of project
		files for Delphi 10 and Delphi 11, aka BDS 2006 and BDS 2007.  There's incomplete support for Delphi 6
		in the source codes, only a few projects are missing.  For other environments, much more may be missing.
		If you want to make life easy for yourself, just get Delphi 10+ ;-).
	</p>

	</p>

	<hr />


	<h2 id="downloading">Downloading the source code</h2>
	<p>
		If you haven't already done so, retrieve a copy of the source code.<br />
		Preferably, use Subversion to check out a working copy.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use TortoiseSVN (a graphical client), or the command line Subversion client like so:
		<div>
			<code>svn co https://heidisql.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/heidisql/trunk heidisql</code>
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, download a source tarball from the file area:<br />
		<a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=164593&package_id=186427'>
			HeidiSQL file area on SourceForge
		</a>

	<hr />


	<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>
	<p>
		Start by compiling and installing the components that HeidiSQL depends on.
	</p>

	<p>
		HeidiSQL has one directory named "packages" for each component and for HeidiSQL itself, this is where
		you'll find the project files.
	</p>

	<p>
		Delphi has a distinction between "design-time components" and "run-time components".  To compile
		HeidiSQL correctly, the designtime components that it depends on needs to be "Installed" into the
		Borland environment, otherwise Delphi will fail to compile HeidiSQL.  You can Install a project
		by right-clicking the project in the "Project Manager" in Delphi and choosing "Install".
	</p>

	<p>
		Open these projects in Delphi 2006 and perform the action listed:
		(Delphi 2007 users will have to open the *.groupproj files instead of *.bdsproj or *.bdsgroup)
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Relative path</th>
			<th>Action</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>components/edbimage/packages/delphi10/EDBImage.bds<u>group</u></td>
			<td>Build All + Install "DCLSer100"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>components/smdbgrid/packages/delphi10/SMDBGridComponents.bdsproj</td>
			<td>Build All + Install "SMDBGridComponents"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>components/synedit/packages/delphi10/SynEdit.bds<u>group</u></td>
			<td>Build All + Install "SynEdit_D10"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>components/zeosdbo/packages/delphi10/ZeosDbo.bds<u>group</u></td>
			<td>Build All + Install "ZComponentDesign100"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>components/heidisql/packages/delphi10/HeidiComponents.bdsproj</td>
			<td>Build All + Install "HeidiComponents"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>components/virtualtreeview/packages/delphi10/VirtualTrees.bds<u>group</u></td>
			<td>Build All + Install "VirtualTreesD10D"</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		Once you're done, you are ready to compile HeidiSQL itself:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Relative path</th>
			<th>Action</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>packages/delphi10/heidisql.bdsproj</td>
			<td>Build All</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		You should end up with a "heidisql.exe" binary in the "out" folder.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ta-ta!  We're done ;-).
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="#contents">To table of contents</a>
	</p>

	<hr />


	<h2 id="furtherdevelopment">Further development</h2>
	<p>
		Once you've performed the initial steps, Delphi will take care of automatically re-installing
		components when you compile them.
		Thus the "Install" step is no longer necessary, "Build" is all that is needed!
	</p>
	<p>
		For your convenience, there is a project group under <em>superpackages/delphi10/heidisql.bdsgroup</em>
		(Delphi 2007: <em>superpackages/delphi11/heidisql.groupproj</em>)
		which includes both HeidiSQL and all of it's dependencies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using this project group, you have all of the HeidiSQL source code
		conveniently located at your finger tips!
	</p>
	<p>
		You can rebuild and re-install everything by performing a <strong>Build All</strong>
		on the big project group.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: Using the big project group can drain resources.
		If your hardware is not in the big league, you might want to use the
		individual projects instead.
	</p>

	<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

	<h3>"Error Reading Form" / "Class Not Found" error messages</h3>
	<p>
		You might have forgotten to Install some of the components.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, make sure that you choose "Cancel" in this dialog!
		If you do not, BDS will make devastating changes to the source,
		and you'll need to revert those actions (fx. with SVN) before things
		are going to work again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Go back to <a href="#gettingstarted">Getting started</a>, and remember to
		Install the components where it says so ;-).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you still have problems, you can also opt to <a href='#cleaning'>start over</a>.
	</p>

	<h3 id="troubleshooting_1">"Unable to install component" error message</h3>
	<p>
		Remove the (already installed) component by going to Project --> Options --> Packages,
		selecting the relevant component and clicking 'Remove'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then try installing the component again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've successfully installed a design-time component, Delphi should reinstall
		it the next time you compile the package containing the component.
	</p>

	<h3>Component installation seemed to work, but components are still missing</h3>
	<p>
		Nuke all files in your package output directory, eg.
		"%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Borland Studio Projects\Bpl".
	</p>
	<p>
		Then repeat the <a href='#troubleshooting_1'>above step</a>.
	</p>

	<h3 id="cleaning">How can I completely clean my build environment?</h3>
	<p>
		If the HeidiSQL build process has changed, or you think you might have done something
		wrong during building, you might want to clean your build environment.
		You can do like this:
		<ul>
			<li>Close all Delphi <strong>projects</strong>, but leave a Delphi
				<strong>window</strong> open (or open a new one).</li>
			<li>Choose Project --> Default Options --> Delphi for Win32</li>
			<li>Choose "Packages".  Highlight the following packages one by one and
				click the "Remove" button after highlighting each one:
				<ul>
					<li>EDBImage</li>
					<li>HeidiSQL helper components</li>
					<li>SMDBGrid</li>
					<li>SynEdit component suite</li>
					<li>Zeos Database Components</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Nuke all files in your package output directory, eg.
				"%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Borland Studio Projects\Bpl".</li>
			<li>Nuke all files from all HeidiSQL "build" directories, for
				example by performing a fresh checkout.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you can restart your <a href='#gettingstarted'>build process</a>.
	</p>


	<h3>Compiler-error: "FOO.pas: E2225 Never-build package BAR must be recompiled"</h3>
	<p>
		If you get this error while building any component, nuke all files in the
		"build"-folder of the package which causes the problem, then try to recompile.
	</p>
	<p>
		At least for me that worked as I couldn't build the ZComponentDesign-package
		and got this message:<br />
		<cite>ZPropertyEditor.pas: E2225 Never-build package ZComponent must be recompiled</cite>
	</p>


	<h3>Compiler-error: "F1026 File not found: XYZ", although file is definitely existant</h3>
	<p>
		It seems that especially the file ZPlainMysql.inc in the package ZPLain
		is affected by this phenomen. This is a bug in BDS which has been reported
		in 2004, closed for version 10.0.2097.6343. 
		See also <a href="http://qc.borland.com/wc/qcmain.aspx?d=9783">http://qc.borland.com/wc/qcmain.aspx?d=9783</a>:
		<cite>
			Charles Pope: (...) It looks like Error Insight is performing some kind
			of file locking preventing the compiler from being able to access the
			file. (...)
		</cite>
	</p>
	<p>
		Workaround:
		<ol>
			<li>Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Editor Options &gt; Code Insight</li>
			<li>Uncheck at least "Error Insight"</li>
			<li>Restart Borland Developer Studio</li>
		</ol>  
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>SVN commit error: 403 or 500 Forbidden (https://svn.sourceforge.net)</h3>
	<p>
		If you get this error while committing the source code:<br />
		<cite>
			Error: COPY of &lt;some_file&gt;: 403 Forbidden (https://svn.sourceforge.net)
		</cite>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Solution: Just <strong>relocate</strong> the repository URL to this one:
		<cite>
			https://heidisql.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/heidisql
		</cite>

		Via commandline:
		<cite>
			svn switch --relocate https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/heidisql TO
			https://heidisql.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/heidisql
		</cite>
		Via TortoiseSVN:
		<cite>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the folder where you checked out HeidiSQL</li>
				<li>Rightclick root-folder</li>
				<li>"TortoiseSVN" submenu</li>
				<li>"Relocate"</li>
				<li>[type in the new URL from above]</li>
			</ol>

	<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

	<h3>What's the difference between designtime and runtime components?</h3>
	<p>
		(Note: "a component" in this context equals "a project".)
	</p>
	<p>
		Designtime components are meant to provide functionality to the Borland environment.  For example,
		a designtime component often has a procedure named "Register", which will install the component into
		the Borland environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea of separating designtime and runtime is that designtime code does not need to be linked
		into the final executable, thus saving space.  See this article for details:<br />
		<a href='http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,27717,00.html'>http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,27717,00.html</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		If in doubt, you can always choose "designtime and runtime".  If you do designate a project as being
		"designtime only", but some code is really required at runtime, the linker seems to be clever enough
		to include the component in the final executable anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		Runtime components are meant to be included in the final executable.  Runtime components can probably
		not be "Installed" into the Borland environment.  Runtime components can be compiled into BPL files,
		which is a sort of fancy DLL.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can Google for more information about components here:<br />
		<a href='http://groups.google.com/groups/dir?sel=33614735'>borland.public.delphi.vcl usenet groups</a><br />
		<a href='http://groups.google.com/groups/dir?sel=33614713'>borland.public.cppbuilder.vcl usenet groups</a>
	</p>

	<h3>How do I find out what's changed in a ".res" file?</h3>
	<p>
		I have no clue.  If you find out, please update this readme.<br />
		Supposedly, one can use textual RC files instead of binary RES files, and by adding the RC files to
		a project, Delphi should compile them into RES files on demand.  That's probably what we should do.
	</p>

	<h3>What tool is practical for editing the multi-icon bitmap in /res/icons8bit.bmp?</h3>
	<p>
		While this file is a simple windows-bitmap (.bmp) with 256 colors, one way is to
		use "Paint" from within the Windows accessories - it has everything you need for this task.
		But obviously design-people would prefer a more powerful software like Photoshop or
		something similar. However, a good and free alternative for beginners and intermediate
		designers is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=paint.net+download">Paint.NET</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>What should I do before editing this readme?</h3>
	<p>
		You need to put yourself in the shoes of a newbie, and make
		<strong>sure</strong> that the method you're proposing actually works.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			First, go through the actions listed in <a href="#cleaning">cleaning the build environment</a> methodically.
		</li>
		<li>
			Next, try your solution step-by-step.
		</li>
		<li>
			If everything works, you're good to change the readme!

	<h2 id="releasing">Releasing a new version (for core developers)</h2>

	<p>
		In order to keep version numbers in the repository and the released executables in sync,
		it is important to perform releases using an established method.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: All steps are important!
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: Order is important!
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Make sure your working copy contains both "trunk" and "tags" from repository.</strong><br />
			If you need to check out "tags", you may put a tick in 'checkout top folder only' to spare bandwidth.<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Run 'svn update -rHEAD' on the trunk folder.</strong><br />
    		This step ensures that all files copied in the next step are at the same source revision.<br />
		   Using the TortoiseSVN 'svn update' command is fine too.<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Run 'svn copy trunk tags/4.0rc1'.</strong><br />
			This step creates an exact duplicate of the current HEAD revision of trunk.<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Edit the release code variable "appversion" in tags/4.0rc1/main.pas.</strong><br />
			This step modifies above duplicate so it is now different from trunk.<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Run 'svn commit tags' to commit "tags" and all subitems.</strong><br />
			This step creates a repository revision containing the copy with the new appversion.<br />
			This step also writes the new revision number of this change into $Revision$ in main.pas.<br />
			<i>Point of no return!</i>  After this step, the version number is final.<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li><strong><a href='#cleaning'>Clean</a> your build environment.</strong><br />
			This step prevents old binary components from being included in the new version.<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li><strong><a href='#gettingstarted'>Build HeidiSQL</a> from tags/4.0rc1.</strong><br />
			(Under some circumstances it is OK to use one of the superpackages instead of this and the previous step.  If in doubt, don't ;-).)<br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Build installer in the tags/4.0rc1 directory.</strong><br />
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Upload!</strong><br />
			<br />
